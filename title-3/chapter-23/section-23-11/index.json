(a) Within five days after the deadline for the introduction of bills in each legislative session, the clerks of each house of the legislature shall transmit, to the auditor for analysis, copies of all legislative bills that were introduced in their respective houses during that session that propose to establish new special or revolving funds. (b) The criteria to be used by the auditor in analyzing each legislative bill shall include: (1) The need for the fund, as demonstrated by: (A) The purpose of the program to be supported by the fund; (B) The scope of the program, including financial information on fees to be charged, sources of projected revenue, and costs; and &amp;copy; An explanation of why the program cannot be implemented successfully under the general fund appropriation process; and (2) Whether there is a clear nexus between the benefits sought and charges made upon the program users or beneficiaries or a clear link between the program and the sources of revenue, as opposed to serving primarily as a means to provide the program or users with an automatic means of support that is removed from the normal budget and appropriation process. Each analysis shall set forth the probable effects of the proposed fund and shall also assess alternative forms of funding. &amp;copy; No later than thirty days prior to the adjournment sine die of each legislative session, the auditor shall submit the analysis of each transmitted legislative bill to each house of the legislature.
