Whenever the liquor commission is of the opinion that any holder of a club license is not conducting the business under such license in good faith, or that the premises thereof are not continuously kept suitably arranged, furnished, equipped, and actually and reputably operated as a club, or that the apparent or claimed manner of operation of the club as such is only nominal or pretended or amounts to a sham or subterfuge under which liquor is being sold as the principal object of the club, the license may be summarily suspended pending a hearing why it should not be revoked. [L Sp 1933, c 40, §14; RL 1935, §2583; am L 1937, c 211, §9; RL 1945, §7235; RL 1955, §159-33; HRS §281-34] "
