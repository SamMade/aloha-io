SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §§711-1109 TO 711-1110 Act 165, Session Laws 2016, added §711-1109.7, establishing the offense of pet animal or equine animal desertion. The legislature found that thousands of animals, primarily dogs and cats, were abandoned across Hawaii every year, contributing to increased animal control costs, animal suffering and overpopulation, increased euthanasia rates at local animal shelters, and possible harm to native wildlife. The legislature further found that stronger penalties for animal desertion would encourage pet owners to work with local shelters and animal control contractors when a pet must be re-homed, strengthen pet retention and the human-animal bond, and protect pet owners and the animals themselves. Conference Committee Report No. 117-16. "
