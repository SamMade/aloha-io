[L 2002, c 200, pt of §1; am L 2016, c 16, §3] COMMENTARY ON §§707-752 AND 707-753 Act 16, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-752 by amending the definition of the term &amp;ldquo;sexual conduct&amp;rdquo; as that term is used in the Penal Code for the offense of promoting child abuse in the third degree. The amendments made by Act 16 aligned the term, as used in state law, more closely with the terminology used in federal law by expanding the definition of &amp;ldquo;sexual conduct&amp;rdquo; to include specific types of conduct. Act 16 also removed unnecessary and archaic language regarding sexual orientation. House Standing Committee Report No. 1124-16.
