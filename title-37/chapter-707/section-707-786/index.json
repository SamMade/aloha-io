(1) A person commits the offense of nonpayment of wages if the person, in the capacity as an employer of an employee, intentionally or knowingly or with intent to defraud fails or refuses to pay wages to the employee, except where required by federal or state statute or by court process. In addition to any other penalty, a person convicted of nonpayment of wages shall be fined not less than $2,000 nor more than $10,000 for each offense. (2) Nonpayment of wages is: (a) A class C felony, if the amount owed to the employee is equal to or greater than $2,000 or if the defendant convicted of nonpayment of wages falsely denies the amount or validity of the wages owed; or (b) A misdemeanor, if the amount owed to the employee is less than $2,000. (3) A person commits a separate offense under this section for each pay period during which the employee earned wages that the person failed or refused to pay the employee. If no set pay periods were agreed upon between the person and the employee at the time the employee commenced the work, then each &amp;ldquo;pay period&amp;rdquo; shall be deemed to be bi-weekly.

(5) An employee who is the victim of nonpayment of wages may bring a civil action to recover all wages owed by the defendant convicted of nonpayment of wages.
