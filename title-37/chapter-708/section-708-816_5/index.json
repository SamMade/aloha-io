[L 1993, c 12, §1] COMMENTARY ON §708-816.5 Act 12, Session Laws 1993, added this section to establish the offense of unlawful entry upon the premises of a facility used as a sex, child, or spouse abuse shelter, by making it a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly enter or unlawfully remain upon the premises after reasonable warning or request to leave by a facility staff member. Since the locations of these shelters are often known, individuals seeking shelter and shelter staff are at potential risk from abusers.
