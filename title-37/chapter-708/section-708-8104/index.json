  "context": "[ยง708-8104] Possession of unauthorized credit card machinery or incomplete cards. (1) A person other than the cardholder possessing an incomplete credit card, with intent to complete it without the consent of the issuer or a person possessing, with knowledge of its character, machinery, plates, or any other contrivance designed to reproduce instruments purporting to be the credit cards of the issuer who has not consented to the preparation of such credit cards, commits the offense of possession of unauthorized credit card machinery or incomplete cards. A credit card is incomplete if part of the matter other than the signature of the cardholder, which an issuer requires to appear on the credit card, before it can be used by a cardholder, has not yet been stamped, embossed, imprinted, or written on it. If a person other than the cardholder or issuer possesses two or more incomplete credit cards, it is prima facie evidence that the person intended to complete them without the consent of the owner. (2) Possession of unauthorized credit card machinery or incomplete cards is a class C felony. [L 1986, c 314, pt of ยง61] "
