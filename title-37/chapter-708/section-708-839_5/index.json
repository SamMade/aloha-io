[L 1996, c 256, ยง2; am L 2016, c 231, ยง41] COMMENTARY ON ยง708-839.5 Act 256, Session Laws 1996, added this section, which establishes and defines the crime of theft of utility services. The legislature recognized that theft of utility services was widespread throughout the utility industry, that utility companies often spread the loss of revenues from the thefts to rate payers, and that attempting to steal utility services can pose a threat of physical injury to innocent persons and the thief. The legislature also acknowledged that current theft statutes do not specifically provide for thefts of utility services. The legislature found that a new type of theft needed to be established to deter the theft of utility services. House Standing Committee Report No. 1519-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2062. Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (4) by raising the monetary threshold for the offense. The amendment implemented recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015). "
