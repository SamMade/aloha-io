[L 2012, c 125, ยง1] COMMENTARY ON ยง708-835.55 Act 125, Session Laws 2012, added this section, requiring persons sentenced for theft in the first, second, third, or fourth degree for an offense involving theft of an agricultural product or commodity to pay restitution to the victim in an amount equal to the value of what was stolen and the cost of replanting. The legislature found that agricultural theft continues to be a significant problem in the State and has resulted in millions of dollars in losses for the agricultural industry. The legislature further found that existing laws were not stringent enough to deter potential thieves. Act 125 would allow prosecutors to develop stronger cases against thieves of agricultural products and commodities.
