(2) Unlicensed contracting activity is a misdemeanor. (3) Each day the violation of this section continues after written notice of the violation to the unlicensed contractor shall constitute a distinct and separate offense. (4) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that the defendant was a licensed contractor performing activity outside the scope of the defendant&amp;rsquo;s contractor&amp;rsquo;s license. This defense shall not preclude any administrative or civil enforcement action for the unlicensed activity. [L 2012, c 244, pt of ยง1; am L 2013, c 182, ยง2] "
