      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Burglary in the first degree</h2>
      <p><strong>PART II. BURGLARY AND OTHER OFFENSES OF INTRUSION</strong></p>

<p><strong>§708-810 Burglary in the first degree.</strong> (1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the first degree if the person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in a building, with intent to commit therein a crime against a person or against property rights, and:</p>

<p>(a) The person is armed with a dangerous instrument in the course of committing the offense;</p>

<p>(b) The person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury on anyone in the course of committing the offense; or</p>

<p>&copy; The person recklessly disregards a risk that the building is the dwelling of another, and the building is such a dwelling.</p>

<p>(2) An act occurs &ldquo;in the course of committing the offense&rdquo; if it occurs in effecting entry or while in the building or in immediate flight therefrom.</p>

<p>(3) Burglary in the first degree is a class B felony. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]</p>

<p>Revision Note</p>

<p>In subsection (1)(a), &ldquo;or&rdquo; deleted pursuant to §23G-15.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>No merit to defendant&rsquo;s arguments regarding defendant&rsquo;s sentence, where defendant contended, inter alia, that repeat offender statute did not apply to defendant&rsquo;s offense, where defendant was convicted of burglary in first degree of a dwelling in violation of subsection (1)&copy;. 105 F.3d 463 (1997).</p>

<p>Accomplice. 58 H. 404, 570 P.2d 844 (1977).</p>

<p>Although there was no direct evidence that appellant did not have permission to enter residence, a reasonable mind could infer that appellant did not have permission. 78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80 (1995).</p>

<p>First degree burglary not an included offense of first degree robbery. 81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210 (1996).</p>

<p>A perpetrator &ldquo;remains unlawfully&rdquo; for the purposes of a burglary prosecution only in situations where the individual makes an initial lawful entry, that subsequently becomes unlawful. 89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287 (1998).</p>

<p>Because the broad language of this section does not evidence an intent to confine crimes &ldquo;against a person&rdquo; to those enumerated in chapter 707, and harassment under §711-1106 is a crime against a person, burglary conviction under this section may be predicated on offense of harassment. 89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287 (1998).</p>

<p>In order to sustain a burglary conviction under this section, the evidence must show that the unlawful entry was effected for the purpose of committing an offense against a person or property rights; the intent to commit the offense must have existed at the time the unlawful entry was made. 89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287 (1998).</p>

<p>Where trial court failed to correct prosecution&rsquo;s erroneous interpretation of &ldquo;remains unlawfully&rdquo; under this section, defendant&rsquo;s constitutional rights to due process and a unanimous jury verdict violated. 89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287 (1998).</p>

<p>Theft in the second degree is not a lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree. 2 H. App. 579, 637 P.2d 780 (1981).</p>

<p>Conviction of first degree burglary affirmed where defendant intentionally entered a separately secured bedroom and bath area of nightclub. 9 H. App. 307, 837 P.2d 1308 (1992).</p>

<p>Conviction affirmed, where defendant argued that court erred in denying defendant&rsquo;s motion for judgment of acquittal on burglary in first degree count on ground that, since tent defendant was charged with having entered was not a building, it was not a dwelling within definition of this section. 9 H. App. 368, 842 P.2d 267 (1992).</p>

<p>Prosecution satisfied its burden of proving that storage shed was in a garage that was part of a building that was a dwelling. 86 H. 143 (App.), 948 P.2d 564 (1997).</p>

<p>As robbery in the first degree under §708-840(1)(b)(ii) does not include the element required under subsection (1)&copy; for burglary in the first degree of intentionally entering or remaining unlawfully in a building, it was possible for defendant to commit robbery in the first degree without committing burglary in the first degree; thus the crimes are not included in each other and do not merge. 109 H. 327 (App.), 126 P.3d 370 (2005).</p>
