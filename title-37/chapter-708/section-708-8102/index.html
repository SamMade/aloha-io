      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Theft, forgery, etc., of credit cards</h2>
      <p><strong>[ยง708-8102] Theft, forgery, etc., of credit cards.</strong> (1) A person who takes a credit card from the person, possession, custody, or control of another without the cardholder&rsquo;s consent or who, with knowledge that it has been so taken, receives the credit card with intent to use it or to sell it, or to transfer it to a person other than the issuer or the cardholder commits the offense of credit card theft. If a person has in the person&rsquo;s possession or under the person&rsquo;s control credit cards issued in the names of two or more other persons, which have been taken or obtained in violation of this subsection, it is prima facie evidence that the person knew that the credit cards had been taken or obtained without the cardholder&rsquo;s consent.</p>

<p>(2) A person who receives a credit card that the person knows to have been lost, mislaid, or delivered under a mistake as to the identity or address of the cardholder, and who retains possession with intent to use it or to sell it or to transfer it to a person other than the issuer or the cardholder commits the offense of credit card theft.</p>

<p>(3) A person, other than the issuer, who sells a credit card or a person who buys a credit card from a person other than the issuer commits the offense of credit card theft.</p>

<p>(4) A person who, with intent to defraud the issuer, a person or organization providing money, goods, services, or anything else of value, or any other person, obtains control over a credit card as security for a debt commits the offense of credit card theft.</p>

<p>(5) A person, other than the issuer, who during any twelve-month period, receives credit cards issued in the names of two or more persons which the person has reason to know were taken or retained under circumstances which constitute credit card theft or a violation of section 708-8101, commits the offense of credit card theft.</p>

<p>(6) A person who, with intent to defraud a purported issuer, a person or organization providing money, goods, services, or anything else of value, or any other person, falsely makes or falsely embosses a purported credit card or utters such a credit card, or possesses such a credit card with knowledge that the same has been falsely made or falsely embossed commits the offense of credit card forgery. If a person other than the purported issuer possesses two or more credit cards which have been made or embossed in violation of this subsection, it is prima facie evidence that the person intended to defraud or that the person knew the credit cards had been so made or embossed. A person falsely makes a credit card when the person makes or draws, in whole or in part, a device or instrument which purports to be the credit card of a named issuer but which is not such a credit card because the issuer did not authorize the making or drawing, or alters a credit card which was validly issued. A person falsely embosses a credit card who, without authorization of the named issuer, completes a credit card by adding any of the matter, other than the signature of the cardholder, which an issuer requires to appear on the credit card before it can be used by a cardholder.</p>

<p>(7) A person other than the cardholder or a person authorized by the cardholder who, with intent to defraud the issuer, or a person or organization providing money, goods, services, or anything else of value, or any other person, signs a credit card, commits the offense of credit card forgery.</p>

<p>(8) Credit card theft is a class C felony.</p>

<p>(9) Credit card forgery is a class C felony. [L 1986, c 314, pt of ยง61]</p>
