L 2016, c 228, ยง8.] The possession, cultivation, sale, receipt, or transfer of industrial hemp as authorized under part II of chapter 141 shall not constitute an offense under this part. [L 2016, c 228, ยง4] COMMENTARY ON ยง712-1260 Act 228, Session Laws 2016, added this section to exempt the possession, cultivation, sale, receipt, or transfer of industrial hemp in accordance with the industrial hemp pilot program established by Act 228 from acts constituting offenses related to drugs and intoxicating compounds. The legislature found that industrial hemp is well suited to Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s climate and soil and can grow to over ten feet in a short period of time with little water and no pesticides. According to estimates by the Hemp Industries Association, retail sales of industrial hemp products grew to over $620,000,000 annually in 2014. Industrial hemp has over 25,000 uses, including food, fiber, and fuel products, and has high potential to contribute to the future viability of the State&amp;rsquo;s agricultural industry.
