<p>COMMENTARY ON ยง712-1210</p>

<p>Act 106, Session Laws 1981, added the definition of &ldquo;community standards,&rdquo; to mean a statewide standard. It also amended the definitions of &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo; and &ldquo;pornographic to minors.&rdquo; The conference committee stated in its report (Senate Conference Committee Report No. 14 and House Conference Committee Report No. 12) that the amendments were merely to conform the definitions to the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) and the Hawaii supreme court in State v. Manzo, 58 Haw. 440 (1978).</p>

<p>Act 240, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by adding definitions to comport with sexual exploitation of a minor offenses created by the Act.</p>

<p>Act 10, Session Laws 2005, amended this section by repealing the superfluous definition of &ldquo;sexual conduct&rdquo; added by Act 240, Session Laws 2002. This section already provided a sufficient definition of &ldquo;sexual conduct.&rdquo; House Standing Committee Report No. 1281.</p>

<p>Act 16, Session Laws 2016, amended this section by amending the definition of the term &ldquo;sexual conduct&rdquo; as that term is used in the penal code for offenses related to obscenity, by removing unnecessary and archaic language regarding sexual orientation. House Standing Committee Report No. 1124-16.</p>

<p>Law Journals and Reviews</p>

<p>State v. Kam: The Constitutional Status of Obscenity in Hawaii. 11 UH L. Rev. 253 (1989).</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Grand jury was presented with sufficient information to determine the existence of probable cause that material distributed to minor by defendant was pornographic for minors under paragraph (7)(a). 82 H. 474, 923 P.2d 891 (1996).</p>

<p>Based on the plain language and legislative history of ยง707-700 and construing the definition of &ldquo;sexual contact&rdquo; with reference to other definitions relating to sexual relations in ยง707-700 and this section, contact with the interior of the mouth constitutes &ldquo;touching of intimate parts&rdquo; under the definition of &ldquo;sexual contact&rdquo; in ยง707-700. 108 H. 279, 118 P.3d 1222 (2005).</p>

<p>Where the definition of &ldquo;sexual conduct&rdquo; under this section includes &ldquo;physical contact with a person&rsquo;s clothed or unclothed ย buttocks ย for the purposes of sexual stimulation, gratification, or perversion&rdquo;, an in pari materia reading of this section as well as the legislative history of ยง707-700 supports the conclusion that the legislature intended the buttocks to be an &ldquo;intimate part&rdquo; for purposes of &ldquo;sexual contact&rdquo; as that phrase is defined in ยง707-700. 125 H. 1, 249 P.3d 1141 (2011).</p>

<p><strong>Pornographic.</strong></p>

<p>Construed; provision not unconstitutional for overbreadth or void for vagueness. 58 H. 440, 573 P.2d 945 (1977).</p>

<p>Material held to be &ldquo;utterly without redeeming social value&rdquo;. 63 H. 418, 629 P.2d 1130 (1981).</p>

<p>Cited: 413 U.S. 15.</p>
