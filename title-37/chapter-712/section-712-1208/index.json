(2) &amp;ldquo;Travel services&amp;rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 468L-1. (3) Promoting travel for prostitution is a class C felony. [L 2004, c 82, ยง2] COMMENTARY ON ยง712-1208 Act 82, Session Laws 2004, added this section, making it a class C felony to sell or offer to sell travel services promoting prostitution. The legislature found that the sex industry has expanded to include people in the travel industry arranging for travelers to take advantage of prostitution overseas. These profiteers should not be promoting in Hawaii overseas activities that are illegal in this State. The legislature found that establishing a new offense of promoting travel for prostitution recognizes that travel businesses should be held accountable for their roles, if any, in encouraging prostitution and the consequent abuse and exploitation of women.
