  "context": "§712-1217 Open lewdness. (1) A person commits the offense of open lewdness if in a public place the person does any lewd act which is likely to be observed by others who would be affronted or alarmed. (2) Open lewdness is a petty misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993] Cross References Indecent exposure, see §707-734. COMMENTARY ON §712-1217 This section penalizes open lewdness which does not amount to a sexual offense under chapter 707 of this Code, but which &amp;ldquo;amounts to gross flouting of community standards in respect to sexuality or nudity in public.&amp;rdquo;[1] The section does not apply to cult nudism because of the requirement that the act take place when it is known by the actor that the actor&amp;rsquo;s conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm.
