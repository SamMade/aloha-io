When the law provides that negligence is sufficient to establish an element of an offense, that element also is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. When the law provides that recklessness is sufficient to establish an element of an offense, that element also is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally or knowingly. When the law provides that acting knowingly is sufficient to establish an element of an offense, that element also is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally. [L 1972, c 9, pt of ยง1] COMMENTARY ON ยง702-208 Since intent, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence are in a descending order of culpability, this section establishes that &amp;ldquo;it is only necessary to articulate the minimal basis of liability for the more serious bases to be implied.&amp;rdquo;[1] The proposition is essentially axiomatic. __________ ยง702-208 Commentary: 1.
