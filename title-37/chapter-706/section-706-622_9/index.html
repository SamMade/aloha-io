      <p><strong>§706-622.9 Sentencing for first-time property offenders; expungement.</strong> (1) Notwithstanding section 706-620(3), a person convicted for the first time of any class C felony property offense under chapter 708 who has not previously been sentenced under section 706-606.5, section 706-622.5, or this section is eligible to be sentenced to probation under subsection (2) if the person meets the following criteria:</p>

<p>(a) The court has determined that the person is nonviolent after reviewing the person&rsquo;s criminal history, the factual circumstances of the offense for which the person is being sentenced, and any other relevant information;</p>

<p>(b) The person has been assessed by a certified substance abuse counselor to be in need of substance abuse treatment due to dependency or abuse under the applicable Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and Addiction Severity Index;</p>

<p>&copy; The court has determined that the offense for which the person is being sentenced is related to the person&rsquo;s substance abuse dependency or addiction;</p>

<p>(d) The court has determined that the person is genuinely motivated to obtain and maintain substance abuse treatment, based upon consideration of the person&rsquo;s history, including whether substance abuse treatment has previously been afforded to the person, and an appraisal of the person&rsquo;s current circumstances and attitude; and</p>

<p>(e) Except for those persons directed to substance abuse treatment under the supervision of the drug court, the person presents a proposal to receive substance abuse treatment in accordance with the treatment plan prepared by a certified substance abuse counselor through a substance abuse treatment program that includes an identified source of payment for the treatment program.</p>

<p>(2) A person eligible under subsection (1) may be sentenced to probation to undergo and complete a substance abuse treatment program if the court determines that the person can benefit from substance abuse treatment and, notwithstanding that the person would be subject to sentencing as a repeat offender under section 706-606.5, the person should not be incarcerated to protect the public. If the person fails to complete the substance abuse treatment program and the court determines that the person cannot benefit from any other suitable substance abuse treatment program, the person shall be sentenced as provided in this part. As a condition of probation under this subsection, the court may direct the person to undergo and complete substance abuse treatment under the supervision of the drug court if the person has a history or relapse in treatment programs. The court may require other terms and conditions of probation, including requiring that the person contribute to the cost of the substance abuse treatment program, comply with deadlines for entering into the substance abuse treatment program, and reside in a secure drug treatment facility.</p>

<p>(3) Upon written application from a person sentenced under this part or a probation officer, the court shall issue a court order to expunge the record of conviction for that particular offense; provided that a person has successfully completed the substance abuse treatment program and complied with other terms and conditions of probation. A person sentenced to probation under this section shall be eligible for expungement under this subsection only if the person has not been previously convicted of a felony offense in this or another jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to give rise to a cause of action against the State, a state employee, or a treatment provider.</p>

<p>(5) For the purposes of this section, &ldquo;substance abuse treatment program&rdquo; means drug or substance abuse treatment services provided outside a correctional facility by a public, private, or nonprofit entity that specializes in treating persons who are diagnosed with having substance abuse or dependency and preferably employs licensed professionals or certified substance abuse counselors. [L 2006, c 230, §1; am L Sp 2009, c 4, §4; am L 2016, c 231, §22]</p>

<p>COMMENTARY ON §706-622.9</p>

<p>Act 230, Session Laws 2006, added §706-622.9, to provide guidelines for the sentencing of first-time property offenders and the expungement of records. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.</p>

<p>Act 4, Special Session Laws 2009, amended subsection (2) authorizing the placement of certain drug offenders in secure drug treatment facilities, to promote the rehabilitation of convicted drug offenders through alternatives to incarceration. The legislature found that providing convicted drug offenders with drug rehabilitation programs in a secure drug treatment facility would reduce the offenders&rsquo; rate of recidivism upon release and help the offenders develop an important and meaningful role in society. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1285, Conference Committee Report No. 25.</p>

<p>Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (3) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).</p>
