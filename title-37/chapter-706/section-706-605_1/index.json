COMMENTARY ON §706-605.1 Act 25, Special Session Laws 1995, added this section, which requires the judiciary to implement alternative programs that place, control, supervise, and treat selected defendants in lieu of an incarceration sentence. The legislature addressed the problem of prison overcrowding by, inter alia, providing for the implementation of alternatives to incarceration that do not undermine public safety. House Standing Committee Report No. 23-S, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2-S (1995 Special Session). See also Conference Committee Report No. 122, Senate Bill No. 82 (vetoed). Act 4, Special Session Laws 2009, amended this section, authorizing the placement of certain drug offenders in secure drug treatment facilities, to promote the rehabilitation of convicted drug offenders through alternatives to incarceration. The legislature found that providing convicted drug offenders with drug rehabilitation programs in a secure drug treatment facility would reduce the offenders&amp;rsquo; rate of recidivism upon release and help the offenders develop an important and meaningful role in society. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1285, Conference Committee Report No. 25. Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).
