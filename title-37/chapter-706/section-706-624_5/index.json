(1) Whenever the court places a defendant convicted of an offense against the person as described in chapter 707, or of an attempt to commit such an offense on probation without requiring the serving of a term of imprisonment, the court shall provide written notice to each victim of such offense of the probation, whenever the victim has made a written request for such notice. Notice shall be given to the victim at the address given on the request for notice or such other address as may be provided to the court by the victim from time to time. (2) Neither the failure of any state officer or employee to carry out the requirements of this section nor compliance with it shall subject the State or the officer or employee to liability in any civil action. However, such failure may provide a basis for such disciplinary action as may be deemed appropriate by competent authority.

COMMENTARY ON §706-624.5 Act 184, Session Laws 1983, added this section to require notification to a crime victim if a defendant who harmed the victim is released into the community after conviction. This addition was intended to insure that crime victims &amp;ldquo;are treated with fairness and respect&amp;rdquo; and that agencies in the criminal justice system cooperate with each other to provide information and other help to crime victims.
