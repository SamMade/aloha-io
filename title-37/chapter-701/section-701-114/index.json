SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §701-114 Section 114(2) of the Proposed Draft of the Code had provided that the &amp;ldquo;innocence of the defendant is assumed.&amp;rdquo; The legislature found that &amp;ldquo;the use of the word &amp;lsquo;assumed&amp;rsquo; in this manner is novel and prefers the term &amp;lsquo;presumed&amp;rsquo; since it has a definite meaning in jurisprudence.&amp;rdquo; Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972). Act 136, Session Laws 1973, amended this section by adding the introductory phrase now contained in subsection (1) (&amp;ldquo;Except as otherwise provided in section 701-115, &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;) to eliminate the possibility of confusion in the application of §§701-114 and 701-115.
