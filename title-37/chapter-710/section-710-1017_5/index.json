COMMENTARY ON ยง710-1017.5 Act 230, Session Laws 2001, created the criminal offense of the sale or manufacture of deceptive identification documents. Testimony regarding the measure indicated that identification documents, such as driver licenses, identification cards, and birth certificates, have become prey to unscrupulous commercial enterprises that have created a market for selling falsified official identification documents.
