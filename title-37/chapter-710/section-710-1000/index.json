[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1987, c 130, §1; gen ch 1993; am L 2014, c 33, §2] Revision Note Numeric designations deleted and definitions rearranged pursuant to §23G-15. COMMENTARY ON §710-1000 This section is definitional only and, of course, specifies no offense. A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing the terms defined. SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1000 Act 33, Session Laws 2014, amended this section by adding the following definitions: &amp;ldquo;electronic,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;falsely alter,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;falsely complete,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;falsely make,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;information,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;record.&amp;rdquo; Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3330, House Standing Committee Report No. 260-14. Case Notes Plaintiffs failed to establish that defendant received pecuniary benefit from five million dollar gift to city and county of Honolulu. 906 F. Supp. 1377 (1995). &amp;ldquo;Custody&amp;rdquo; construed. 59 H. 456, 583 P.2d 337 (1978). The offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree does not require a nexus between the alleged threat and the threatened person&amp;rsquo;s status as a public servant where the threatened person is a government officer or employee; thus, trial court did not err in failing to give a nexus instruction. 111 H. 327, 141 P.3d 974 (2006). Under paragraph (15), any &amp;ldquo;officer or employee of any branch of government&amp;rdquo; qualifies as a public servant. 105 H. 261 (App.), 96 P.3d 590 (2004). Under paragraph (15), a person qualifies as a public servant based on the type of work he or she performs, and not based on when that work is being performed. 105 H. 261 (App.), 96 P.3d 590 (2004). There was no support for the government&amp;rsquo;s argument that paragraph (3) [defining &amp;ldquo;custody&amp;rdquo;] sets forth &amp;ldquo;elements&amp;rdquo; that the prosecution must prove in order to sustain a conviction under §710-1021; none of the modes of custody set forth in paragraph (3) is an element of the crime of escape from custody. 782 F.3d 510 (2015).
