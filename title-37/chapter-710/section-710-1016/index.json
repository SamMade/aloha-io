  "context": "§710-1016 Impersonating a public servant. (1) A person commits the offense of impersonating a public servant if the person pretends to be a public servant other than a law enforcement officer and engages in any conduct in that capacity with intent to deceive anyone. (2) It is no defense to a prosecution under this section that the office the person pretended to hold did not in fact exist. (3) Impersonating a public servant is a misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1984, c 139, §2; am L 2001, c 91, §4] Cross References Harassment by impersonation, see §711-1106.6. COMMENTARY ON §710-1016 The object of this section is to prevent imposition on people by the false pretense of authority. Previous Hawaii law recognized the offense of false personation of a government officer and imposed a possible maximum sentence of one year&amp;rsquo;s imprisonment or a fine of $100.[1] The Code authorizes the same imprisonment, but a greater fine, for misdemeanors. Excluded from part II are offenses involving falsity which borders on perjury, e.g., false application or consent to marriage, false impersonation before a court.[2] These problems are dealt with directly in part VI of this chapter. Statutory protection for private fraternal organizations, by making unauthorized display of the badge or insignia of the organization a crime, is eliminated.[3] Also eliminated is the questionable distinction between the penalty which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a police officer&amp;rsquo;s uniform or badge and that which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a uniform or badge which resembles a police officer&amp;rsquo;s.[4] Both situations are covered equally under this section provided other requirements are met. SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1016 Act 139, Session Laws 1984, amended this section to exclude the offense of impersonating a peace officer, which offense was made a class C felony. Case Notes Trial court properly found defendant guilty of impersonating a public servant under this section where defendant wrote and signed a letter to defendant&amp;rsquo;s attorney, in the name of defendant&amp;rsquo;s supervisor, requesting the attorney to ask the presiding judge to drop contempt charges against defendant. 94 H. 440 (App.), 16 P.3d 845 (2000). §710-1016 Commentary: 1. H.R.S. §742-2. 2. See H.R.S. §742-1. 3. Id. §742-5. 4. Compare id. §§742-3 with 742-4. "
