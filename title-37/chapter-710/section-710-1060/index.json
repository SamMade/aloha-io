(1) A person commits the offense of perjury if in any official proceeding the person makes, under an oath required or authorized by law, a false statement which the person does not believe to be true. (2) No person shall be convicted under this section unless the court rules that the false statement is a &amp;ldquo;materially false statement&amp;rdquo; as defined by section [710-1000].
