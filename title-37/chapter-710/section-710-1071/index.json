  "context": "§710-1071 Intimidating a witness. (1) A person commits the offense of intimidating a witness if he uses force upon or a threat directed to a witness or a person he believes is about to be called as a witness in any official proceeding, with intent to: (a) Influence the testimony of that person; (b) Induce that person to avoid legal process summoning him to testify; or &amp;copy; Induce that person to absent himself from an official proceeding to which he has been legally summoned. (2) &amp;ldquo;Threat&amp;rdquo; as used in this section means any threat proscribed by section 707-764(1). (3) Intimidating a witness is a class C felony. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1980, c 267, §2] COMMENTARY ON §710-1071 The potential for harm involved in witness intimidation is essentially similar to that involved in the offense of bribery of a witness, e.g., the undermining of the integrity of an extremely important part of the judicial process. The definition of the offense also parallels that of bribery of a witness, and the sanctions are identical. Note, however, that only the person who directs the force or threat against the witness is guilty of a crime. &amp;ldquo;Threat,&amp;rdquo; as used in this section is any threat proscribed by the offense of criminal coercion under §707-724. To some extent, it would seem that the section on criminal coercion might suffice to deal with witness intimidation, but since the intimidation of a witness carries the additional harm of interfering with an official proceeding, it seems appropriate to impose a more severe sanction for the present offense. Previous Hawaii law had no provisions dealing specifically with the offense of witness intimidation. Case Notes Terroristic threatening not a lesser included offense of intimidating a witness within the meaning of §701-109(4)(a); multiple conviction of terroristic threatening and intimidating a witness not barred by §701-109(4)&amp;copy;. 75 H. 517, 865 P.2d 157 (1994). Sufficient evidence that defendant directed threats to person whom defendant believed was about to be called as a witness where defendant phoned person soon after explicit warning from police officer that such conduct could be inferred as intimidating a witness. 82 H. 419 (App.), 922 P.2d 1032 (1996). Sufficient evidence that defendant intended to influence person&amp;rsquo;s testimony by making threatening statements during phone call. 82 H. 419 (App.), 922 P.2d 1032 (1996). "
