[L 1986, c 314, ยง72] Revision Note Section was enacted as an addition to chapter 710 but was renumbered to this chapter pursuant to ยง23G-15. COMMENTARY ON ยง709-904.5 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, provided for enhanced sentences for an adult offering to pay a juvenile to commit a crime. This offense is aimed at deterring adults from inducing juveniles to engage in criminal activity, a practice frequently used because juveniles are generally given lesser sentences than those for adults for the same crime. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86. Case Notes Defendant could not be convicted for compensating juvenile for defendant&amp;rsquo;s commission of sexual assault against juvenile. 85 H. 92 (App.), 937 P.2d 933 (1997). "
