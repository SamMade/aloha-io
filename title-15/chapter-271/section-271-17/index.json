No certificate or permit shall be issued to a motor carrier or remain in force unless such carrier complies with such reasonable rules and regulations as the public utilities commission shall prescribe governing the filing and approval of surety bonds, policies of insurance, qualifications as a self-insurer, or other securities or agreements, in such reasonable amounts as the commission may require, conditioned to pay within the amount of the surety agreements moneys finally recovered against the motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles under the certificate, or permit or for loss or damage to property of others.
