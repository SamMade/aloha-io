The commission, upon its own initiative or upon complaint, if it considers the action to be in the public interest, may investigate and determine whether any Hawaii air carrier has been or is engaged in unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation or the sale thereof. If the commission finds, after notice and hearing, that a carrier is engaged in unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition, it shall order the carrier to cease and desist from those practices or methods of competition. Notwithstanding section 480-2(d), a complaint may be made by any person, a government, or competing carrier and may relate to practices involving advertising and marketing, service and ancillary services, pricing, or any other aspect of the operations of a Hawaii air carrier.
