  "context": "[§279A-6 Work program.] The state department of transportation shall formulate a detailed work program through which the statewide transportation plan mandated by this chapter shall be developed. The work program shall be approved by the council no later than September 1, 1975. The council shall report thereafter annually to the legislature on the progress that has been made to date as measured against the work plan. The work program shall provide for a systematic planning interface among the ongoing planning activities of the counties, the state department of transportation, and the council itself. The work program shall include specific target dates for the provision of identified planning inputs from the responsible state and county functional agencies into the statewide planning process. In determining this schedule, the council shall solicit from the counties their present transportation planning schedules for intra-county systems, and the council&amp;rsquo;s work program shall reflect the counties&amp;rsquo; existing work product schedule and planning cycles. [L 1975, c 179, §6] "
