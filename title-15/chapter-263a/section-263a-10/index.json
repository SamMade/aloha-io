(b) In any criminal prosecution for a violation of section 263-11, the amount of alcohol found in the defendant&amp;rsquo;s blood within four hours after the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the defendant&amp;rsquo;s blood or breath or other approved analytical technique shall be competent evidence of whether or not the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the alleged violation, and shall give rise to the following presumptions: (1) If there were two-hundredths per cent or less by weight of alcohol in the defendant&amp;rsquo;s blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the alleged violation.
