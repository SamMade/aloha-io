(b) Upon receipt of the affidavit, the district judge shall hold a hearing as provided in section 263A-6, and shall determine whether the statements contained in the affidavit are true. If the district judge finds the statements contained in the affidavit are true, the judge shall prohibit the person from operating an aircraft from a state or private airport for a period of one year. &amp;copy; Whenever a court penalizes a person under this section, it shall also require that the person be referred to a substance abuse counselor who has been certified pursuant to section 321-193 for an assessment of the person&amp;rsquo;s alcohol dependence and the need for treatment.
