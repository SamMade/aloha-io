The purpose of this program is to: (1) Maintain affordable, just, and reasonable rates for basic residential telecommunications service, as defined by the commission; (2) Assist customers located in the areas of the State that have high costs of essential telecommunications service, low-income customers, and customers with disabilities, in obtaining and maintaining access to a basic set of essential telecommunications services as determined by the commission. The commission may expand or otherwise modify relevant programs, such as the lifeline program under section 269-16.5; (3) Ensure that consumers in all communities are provided with access, at reasonably comparable rates, to all telecommunications services which are used by a majority of consumers located in metropolitan areas of the State. The commission shall provide for a reasonable transition period to support the statewide deployment of these advanced telecommunications services, including, but not limited to, the use of strategic community access points in public facilities such as education, library, and health care facilities; (4) Ensure that consumers are given the information necessary to make informed choices among the alternative telecommunications carriers and services; and (5) Promote affordable access throughout the State to enhanced government information and services, including education, health care, public safety, and other government services. The commission shall administer the universal service program, including the establishment of criteria by which the purposes of the program are met. [L 1995, c 225, pt of ยง2] "
