For the purposes of this section, &amp;ldquo;underserved areas&amp;rdquo; means those areas in the State that lack or have very limited access to high capacity, advanced telecommunications networks and information services, including access to cable television. (e) The commission shall require all telecommunications carriers to contribute to the universal service program. The commission may require a person other than a telecommunications carrier to contribute to the universal service program if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the commission determines that the person is offering a commercial service in the State that directly benefits from the telecommunications infrastructure, and that directly competes with a telecommunications service provided in the State for which a contribution is required under this subsection. (f) The commission shall designate the method by which the contributions under subsection (e) shall be calculated and collected. The commission shall consider basing contributions solely on the gross operating revenues from the retail provision of intrastate telecommunications services offered by the telecommunications carriers subject to the contribution.
