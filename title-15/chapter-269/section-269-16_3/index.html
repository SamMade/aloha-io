      <p><strong>ยง269-16.3 Statewide rate increase surcharge assessment on ratepayers in emergency situations.</strong> (a) Any utility that sustains damage to its facilities as a result of a state of emergency or local state of emergency, including emergencies as defined in chapter 127A, and incurs costs related to the restoration and repair of its facilities which, if assessed only on the utility ratepayers of the affected utility service territory, may result in a rate increase of more than fifteen per cent for the average ratepayer in that utility service territory, may apply to the public utilities commission in accordance with this section to recover the costs provided herein through a monthly surcharge which shall be assessed on a statewide basis and shall be based on the utility&rsquo;s net restoration and repair costs; provided that the surcharge shall not result in an assessment of more than fifteen per cent for the average ratepayer in each of the other utility service territories and provided further that the public utilities commission shall exclude ratepayers in utility service territories with rates that may be substantially higher than other utility service territories in the State.</p>

<p>The public utilities commission shall have the authority to initially set, or subsequently revise, the surcharge to reflect the actual net restoration and repair costs incurred after deduction of amounts received from outside sources of recovery. Such outside sources of recovery shall include, but not be limited to, insurance proceeds, government grants, and shareholder contributions.</p>

<p>(b) Any utility meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) may file an application with the public utilities commission setting forth its estimated restoration and repair costs as well as the estimated amount or amounts that may be received from outside sources of recovery.</p>

<p>&copy; Within ninety days after filing of the utility&rsquo;s application, the public utilities commission, upon notice, hearing, and a determination that the application is just, reasonable, and in the public interest, shall:</p>

<p>(1) Decide the extent to which it is just, reasonable, and in the public interest for the damaged utility&rsquo;s ratepayers or shareholders, or both, to bear part or all of the repair and restoration costs;</p>

<p>(2) Determine whether the estimated amount of any net restoration and repair costs to be borne by the ratepayers of the damaged utility would result in a rate increase of more than fifteen per cent for the average residential ratepayer in that utility&rsquo;s service territory;</p>

<p>(3) Issue an order allowing the affected utility or another utility acting on behalf of the affected utility to implement a monthly surcharge on all ratepayers statewide for the type of service rendered by the affected utility if the public utilities commission determines pursuant to paragraph (2) that a rate increase of more than fifteen per cent would otherwise be assessed;</p>

<p>(4) Exclude from any such order ratepayers in utility service territories with rates that are substantially higher than other utility service territories in the State; and</p>

<p>(5) Periodically review the order to ensure that the amounts collected by, or on behalf of, the utility shall not exceed the amount determined by the public utilities commission to be the net restoration and repair costs actually incurred.</p>

<p>The surcharge shall be assessed over a period to be determined by the public utilities commission; provided, however, that the period shall not exceed ten years.</p>

<p>(d) Any outside sources of recovery, including but not limited to grants from federal or state sources, shall be used to offset any repair and restoration costs except where the use of such funds is otherwise limited by the grantor thereof.</p>

<p>(e) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;restoration and repair costs&rdquo; means those costs necessary to restore facilities damaged by a state-declared emergency to a functional level substantially the same as that existing immediately before the emergency and does not include the costs of upgrades or enhancements.</p>

<p>(f) Any utility authorized by the public utilities commission to assess a surcharge pursuant to this section shall state separately the amount of the assessment on each affected ratepayer&rsquo;s monthly bill. [L 1993, c 337, ยง4; am L 2014, c 111, ยง9]</p>
