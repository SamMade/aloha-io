  "context": "[ยง269-166] Green infrastructure fee; nonbypassable. (a) The public utilities commission may create, pursuant to a financing order approved pursuant to section 269-163, a utility-wide nonbypassable surcharge, referred to as the green infrastructure fee, which shall be deposited into the green infrastructure bond fund and be pledged to secure and be applied to the repayment of bonds and related financing costs as described in this part. The green infrastructure fee may be a usage-based surcharge, a flat user fee, or a charge based upon customer revenues as determined by the public utilities commission for each customer class in any financing order. (b) The green infrastructure fee may be applied to reduce the public benefits fee to be transferred pursuant to section 269-121 if so provided in a financing order. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the right to impose, collect, and adjust from time to time the green infrastructure fee as provided in the financing order and this chapter. &amp;copy; As long as any bonds are outstanding and any financing costs have not been paid in full, the green infrastructure fee authorized under any financing order shall be nonbypassable. Subject to any exceptions provided in a financing order, the green infrastructure fee shall be paid by all existing and future customers of electric utilities or any successors. (d) The green infrastructure fee shall be collected by the electric utilities or their successors, as collection agents for the department or the financing parties, in full through a surcharge, fee, or charge that is separate and apart from the electric utilities&amp;rsquo; rates.
