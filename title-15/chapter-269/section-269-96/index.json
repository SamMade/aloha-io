(a) The public utilities commission shall establish energy-efficiency portfolio standards that will maximize cost-effective energy-efficiency programs and technologies. (b) The energy-efficiency portfolio standards shall be designed to achieve four thousand three hundred gigawatt hours of electricity use reductions statewide by 2030; provided that the commission shall establish interim goals for electricity use reduction to be achieved by 2015, 2020, and 2025 and may also adjust the 2030 standard by rule or order to maximize cost-effective energy-efficiency programs and technologies. &amp;copy; The commission may establish incentives and penalties based on performance in achieving the energy-efficiency portfolio standards by rule or order. (d) The public utilities commission shall evaluate the energy-efficiency portfolio standard every five years, beginning in 2013, and may revise the standard, based on the best information available at the time, to determine if the energy-efficiency portfolio standard established by this section remains effective and achievable. The commission shall report its findings and revisions to the energy-efficiency portfolio standard, based on its own studies and other information, to the legislature no later than twenty days before the convening of the regular session of 2014, and every five years thereafter. (e) Beginning in 2015, electric energy savings brought about by the use of renewable displacement or off-set technologies, including solar water heating and sea-water air-conditioning district cooling systems, shall count toward this standard.
