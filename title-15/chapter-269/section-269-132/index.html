      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Certification</h2>
      <p><strong>[ยง269-132] Certification.</strong> (a) Prior to installing a high-voltage electric transmission cable system, a cable company shall be selected through a request for proposals, or other process approved by the commission. The selected cable company shall not commence commercial operations of the high-voltage electric transmission cable system until it is issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the commission pursuant to section 269-7.5. A certified cable company shall be subject to regulation by the commission and defined as a &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; under section 269-1, notwithstanding any law to the contrary.</p>

<p>(b) The electric utility company and the energy resources coordinator, or the energy resources coordinator&rsquo;s designee, shall develop the request for proposals, and the energy resources coordinator or the energy resources coordinator&rsquo;s designee shall be a member of the selection committee that will review and evaluate the proposals. The electric utility company shall suspend or terminate the request for proposals at the discretion of the commission.</p>

<p>&copy; Notwithstanding any provisions in section 269-7.5 to the contrary:</p>

<p>(1) The commission shall approve, disapprove, or approve subject to certain conditions, an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a high-voltage electric transmission cable system, and shall issue a final order within one hundred eighty days after the application is filed, provided that the commission may extend the timeline as necessary;</p>

<p>(2) In determining whether the cable company is financially fit, the commission may allow for the use of commercially reasonable non-recourse project financing for the high-voltage electric transmission cable system;</p>

<p>(3) In determining whether the proposed transmission capacity service is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity, the commission shall determine whether the high-voltage electric transmission cable system would be a cost-effective means of:</p>

<p>(A) Interconnecting two or more electric utility systems;</p>

<p>(B) Helping one or more electric utility companies meet the applicable renewable portfolio standard; or</p>

<p>&copy; Achieving other considerations the commission may deem appropriate;</p>

<p>(4) If the primary source or sources of the renewable electricity that will be transmitted to an electric utility company or companies using the high-voltage electric transmission cable system will be provided pursuant to a power purchase agreement or agreements between the electric utility company or companies and an owner or owners of a new renewable energy generation facility or facilities, in reviewing and approving the application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the commission shall, among other factors, take into consideration:</p>

<p>(A) The status of the power purchase agreement or agreements;</p>

<p>(B) The extent to which the project-on-project financing risk of the high-voltage electric transmission cable system and the associated renewable energy generation facilities is materially reduced through agreements between the certified cable company and the owner or owners of the renewable energy generation facilities holding the power purchase agreement or agreements, or through common ownership arrangements; and</p>

<p>&copy; The extent to which the certified cable company assumes financial responsibility for the high-voltage electric transmission cable system until both the cable system and the new generation facility or facilities have achieved commercial operations;</p>

<p>(5) In the certification process, the commission shall review and determine ratemaking principles appropriate and applicable to the high-voltage electric transmission cable system during commercial operations. The ratemaking principles shall be used in determining the certified cable company&rsquo;s revenue requirement that is used to determine its transmission capacity charges, and may be used to fix the capital investment costs for the high-voltage electric transmission cable system upon which the certified cable company will be allowed to earn an authorized rate of return and the operating costs that may be included in the certified cable company&rsquo;s revenue requirement. Any applicable land costs shall be included in the determination of the certified cable company&rsquo;s revenue requirement;</p>

<p>(6) In determining the authorized rate of return that will apply to a certified cable company, the commission may consider the risks assumed by the certified cable company related to or resulting from the planning, financing, construction, and operation of the high-voltage electric transmission cable system, including other factors deemed relevant and appropriate by the commission, such as the terms and conditions of the transmission tariff as may be approved by the commission; and</p>

<p>(7) Prior to approving the application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the commission shall hold a public hearing on each island to be connected by the high-voltage electric transmission cable system to obtain input from the affected communities about the high-voltage electric transmission cable system.
