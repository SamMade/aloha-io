When the director of transportation determines that the topography of the land will not permit the adequate screening of existing junkyards or that the screening of the junkyards would not be economically feasible, the director may acquire by gift, purchase, exchange, or condemnation, such interests in lands as may be necessary to secure the relocation, removal, or disposal of the junkyards, and pay for the costs of relocation, removal, or disposal thereof. When the director determines that it is in the best interest of the State, the director may acquire such lands, or interests in lands, as may be necessary to provide adequate screening of the junkyards.
