  "context": "ยง264-18 Use of highway fund for bikeways. (a) Out of the state highway fund amounts, whether state funds or federal funds, shall be expended as necessary by the State for the establishment of bikeways; provided that bikeways shall be established, whenever practicable, wherever a new or existing highway, road, or street is being designed, planned, constructed, reconstructed, relocated, or rehabilitated. At least two per cent of eligible federal funds, and in addition, other state highway fund moneys as available, shall be expended to: (1) Establish multi-use paths, bicycle paths, and bicycle lanes; and (2) Install signage and safety devices along bikeways; provided that the department of transportation shall include the bicycling community in a public involvement process to determine the location of multi-use paths, bicycle paths, bicycle lanes, and installation of signage and safety devices along bikeways. Planning for any mass transit system shall include appropriate accommodation for bicycle lanes, bikeways, and bicycle routes, including bicycle racks on mass transit vehicles, to enable mass transit users to connect conveniently by bicycle to transit stations and bus stops. This subsection shall not be construed as requiring the expenditure of a county surcharge on state tax under section 46-16.8, on bicycle paths if the application of this subsection conflicts with section 46-16.8. (b) Bikeways are not required to be established under subsection (a): (1) Where the establishment of the lanes, paths, routes, and ways would be contrary to public safety; or (2) If the cost of establishing the lanes, paths, routes, and ways would be excessively disproportionate to the need or probable use; or (3) Where low population density, other available ways, or other factors indicate an absence of any need for the lanes, paths, routes, and ways; provided that the department of transportation shall involve representatives of the bicycling community, such as the Hawaii Bicycling League, Kauai PATH, Maui Bicycling Alliance, PATH (Big Island), and others in making a determination under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3); provided further that any decision under this subsection shall be documented, including but not limited to, the factors considered in making a decision; and provided further that the department of transportation shall have the burden of persuasion under paragraphs (2) and (3). &amp;copy; The department of transportation, when requested, shall provide technical assistance and advice to counties in carrying out the purpose of this section. The department of transportation shall recommend construction standards for bikeways. The department of transportation, in the manner prescribed for marking highways under section 264-25, shall provide a uniform system of marking and signing such lanes, paths, routes, and ways which shall apply to lanes, paths, routes, and ways under the jurisdiction of the department of transportation and the counties. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the department of transportation and the counties may restrict the use of the lanes, paths, routes, and ways to pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles. (d) As used in this section, the terms &amp;ldquo;bikeway&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bicycle path&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;bicycle lane&amp;rdquo; shall have the same meaning as in section 291C-1. (e) The department of transportation shall report annually to the legislature before the convening of each regular session as to bikeway expenditures and current projects.
