  "context": "[ยง268-2.5 Intra-island water ferry transportation system; authority to implement.] The department of transportation is authorized to implement an intra-island water ferry transportation system subject to chapter 103D. The intra-island water ferry transportation system shall be premised upon the transportation of commuters during peak traffic periods and may be used for other revenue-generating purposes during non-peak traffic periods. The system may include landings at various locations along the southern coast of Oahu and shall be integrated with ground transportation. The department of transportation and the department of land and natural resources are authorized to: (1) Waive or assess nominal fees for the use of public infrastructures and terminals by the operator of the intra-island water ferry transportation system; and (2) Lease public lands at a nominal cost to the operator of the intra-island water ferry transportation system. In return for concessions as determined jointly by the department of transportation and the department of land and natural resources, the operator of the intra-island water ferry transportation system shall provide the ferry service at no cost or nominal cost to the State for the duration of the concessions. Operating expenses may be further supplemented by other revenue-generating activities during non-peak traffic periods. The department of transportation shall aggressively explore the possibility of obtaining federal funds to implement the intra-island water ferry transportation system.
