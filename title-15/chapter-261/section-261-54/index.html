<p>(4) To:</p>

<p>(B) Procure and maintain, or cause to be procured or maintained, to the extent commercially available, a comprehensive insurance policy providing protection and insuring the department and its officers, agents, servants, and employees (and so long as special facility revenue bonds are outstanding, the trustee) against all direct or contingent loss or liability for damages for personal injury or death or damage to property, including loss of use thereof, occurring on or in any way related to the special facility or occasioned by reason of occupancy by and the operations of the other person upon, in, and around the special facility;</p>

<p>&copy; Provide all risk casualty insurance, including insurance against loss or damage by fire, lightning, flood, earthquake, typhoon, or hurricane, with standard extended coverage and standard vandalism and other malicious mischief endorsements; and</p>

<p>provided that all policies with respect to loss or damage of property including fire or other casualty and extended coverage and builder&rsquo;s risk shall provide for payments of the losses to the department, the other person, or the trustee as their respective interests may appear; and provided further that the insurance may be procured and maintained as part of or in conjunction with other policies carried by the other person; and provided further that the insurance shall name the department, and so long as any special facility revenue bonds are outstanding, the trustee, as additional insured; and</p>

<p>(5) To indemnify, save, and hold the department, the trustee and their respective agents, officers, members, and employees harmless from and against all claims and actions and all costs and expenses incidental to the investigation and defense thereof, by or on behalf of any person, firm, or corporation, based upon or arising out of the special facility or the other person&rsquo;s use and occupancy thereof, including, without limitation, from and against all claims and actions based upon and arising from any:</p>
