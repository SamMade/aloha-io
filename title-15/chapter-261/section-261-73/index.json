(b) The director of transportation may cause a derelict aircraft to be immediately taken into custody. Upon taking custody of a derelict aircraft the director shall concurrently: (1) Give public notice of intended disposition; (2) When possible, post a notice of intended disposition on the aircraft; and (3) Serve a duplicate original of the notice of intended disposition by certified mail, return receipt requested: (A) On the registered owner of the aircraft at the last address shown on records in the Federal Aviation Administration; (B) On all lien holders who have filed a financing statement indexed in the name of the registered owner in the bureau of conveyances or who are shown in the records of the Federal Aviation Administration; and &amp;copy; On any other person known to have an interest in the aircraft whose address is known to the department of transportation. If the aircraft is not repossessed within twenty days after the giving and mailing of the notice, whichever occurs later, the aircraft may be disposed of by negotiated sale, except that, when two or more purchasers indicate an interest in purchasing the aircraft, the aircraft will be sold at public auction to the highest bidder. If no purchaser expresses a desire to purchase the aircraft, the aircraft may be destroyed or disposed of by any other method authorized for abandoned aircraft.
