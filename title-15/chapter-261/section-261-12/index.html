The director of transportation may perform such acts, issue and amend such orders, adopt such reasonable general or special rules and procedures, and establish such minimum standards, consistent with this chapter, as the director deems necessary to carry out this chapter and to perform the duties assigned thereunder, all commensurate with and for the purpose of protecting and insuring the general public interest and safety, the safety of persons operating, using, or traveling in aircraft, and the safety of persons and property on land or water, and developing and promoting aeronautics in the State.</p>

<p>(6) Any other matter relating to the health, safety and welfare of the general public and persons operating, using, or traveling in aircraft.</p>

<p>(b) [Tour aircraft operations.] Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, no tour aircraft operation shall be permitted in any airport under the State&rsquo;s control without having a permit. The director shall adopt rules to regulate tour aircraft operations by permit which shall include but not be limited to:</p>

<p>For the purposes of this subsection, &ldquo;tour aircraft operations&rdquo; means any business operation which offers aircraft for hire by passengers for the purpose of aerial observation of landmarks and other manmade or natural sites within an island of the State, and for the purpose of transporting passengers for tourist-related activities.</p>

<p>&copy; Definitions. For the purpose of this section, if not inconsistent with the context:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sterile passenger holding area&rdquo; means any portion of a public airport designated by the director and identified by appropriate signs as an area into which access is conditioned upon the prior inspection of persons and property in accordance with the approved Federal Aviation Administration air carrier screening program.</p>
