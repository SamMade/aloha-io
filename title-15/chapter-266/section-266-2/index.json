Case Notes Power to impose and collect tolls and tonnage charges. 31 H. 372. Power to contract, etc.: limitation on power of board to bind the State. 43 H. 28. Where the department of transportation&amp;rsquo;s (DOT) governing statutes did not explicitly or implicitly authorize the DOT to issue administrative rules exonerating the State from the negligence of its employees, Hawaii administrative rule §19-41-7 did not bear a reasonable relationship to the DOT&amp;rsquo;s statutory mandate, and the legislature&amp;rsquo;s imposition of a statutory duty to defend and/or indemnify in other circumstances demonstrated the legislature&amp;rsquo;s clear intent to reserve such power to itself, trial court erred in obligating appellants to defend and indemnify the State against injured plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claims. 111 H. 144, 140 P.3d 377.
