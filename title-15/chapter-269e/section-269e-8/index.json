The excavator shall indicate the entire dimension of the excavation by known industrial practices and display the excavator&amp;rsquo;s name, abbreviations, or initials next to or in the white spray chalk markings to identify the excavation site. (b) When an excavator delineates an area to be excavated with white spray chalk, the excavator shall delineate the area in a manner that shall not be: (1) Misleading to the public using affected streets and highways; (2) Subject to misinterpretation as a traffic or pedestrian control; and (3) Construed as duplicative. &amp;copy; Where an excavator determines that delineating with white spray chalk may be misleading, misinterpreted, or duplicative as specified under subsection (b), the excavator shall inform the center that the area to be excavated shall instead be identified with flags, stakes, or stake chasers marked with the excavator&amp;rsquo;s name, abbreviations, or initials, to enable the operator to determine the area of excavation.
