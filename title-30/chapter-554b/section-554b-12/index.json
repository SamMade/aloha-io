(a) A claim based on a contract entered into by a custodial trustee acting in a fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial trust property, or a tort committed in the course of administering the custodial trust may be asserted against the custodial trust property by proceeding against the custodial trustee in the fiduciary capacity, whether or not the custodial trustee or the beneficiary is personally liable. (b) A custodial trustee is not personally liable: (1) On a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity unless the custodial trustee fails to reveal that capacity and to identify the custodial trust in the contract; or (2) For an obligation arising from control of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of the administration of the custodial trust unless the custodial trustee is personally at fault. &amp;copy; A beneficiary is not personally liable for an obligation arising from ownership of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of administration of the custodial trust unless the beneficiary is personally in possession of the custodial trust property giving rise to the liability or is personally at fault. (d) Neither subsection (b) or &amp;copy; precludes any proceeding to establish liability of the custodial trustee or beneficiary to the extent that either is protected as the insured by liability insurance.
