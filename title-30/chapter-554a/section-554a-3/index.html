<p>(17) To borrow money to be repaid from trust assets or otherwise; to advance money for the protection of the trust, and for all expenses, losses, and liabilities sustained in the administration of the trust or because of the holding or ownership of any trust assets, for which advances with any interest the trustee has a lien on the trust assets as against the beneficiary;</p>

<p>(18) To pay or contest any claim; to settle a claim by or against the trust by compromise, arbitration, or otherwise; and to release, in whole or in part, any claim belonging to the trust to the extent that the claim is uncollectible;</p>

<p>(20) To allocate items of income or expense to either trust income or principal, as provided by chapter 557A, the Uniform Principal and Income Act, including creation of reserves out of income for depreciation, obsolescence, or amortization, or for depletion in mineral or timber properties;</p>

<p>(24) To prosecute or defend actions, claims, or proceedings for the protection of trust assets and of the trustee in the performance of trustee duties;</p>

<p>(25) To execute and deliver all instruments that will accomplish or facilitate the exercise of the powers vested in the trustee; and</p>
