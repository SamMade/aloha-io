If a check is drawn upon the account of its principal in a bank by a fiduciary who is empowered to draw checks upon the fiduciary&amp;rsquo;s principal&amp;rsquo;s account, the bank is authorized to pay such check without being liable to the principal, unless the bank pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary&amp;rsquo;s obligation as fiduciary in drawing such check, or with knowledge of such facts that its action in paying the check amounts to bad faith. If, however, such a check is payable to the drawee bank and is delivered to it in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to it, the bank is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of the fiduciary&amp;rsquo;s obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the check.
