  "context": "PART III. RECEIPTS NORMALLY APPORTIONED [ยง557A-408] Insubstantial allocations not required. If a trustee determines that an allocation between principal and income required by sections 557A-409 through 557A-412 or section [557A-415] is insubstantial, the trustee may allocate the entire amount to principal if one of the circumstances described in section 557A-104&amp;copy; does not apply to such an allocation. This power may be exercised by a co-trustee in the circumstances described in section 557A-104(d), and it may be released for the reasons and in the manner described in section 557A-104(e). An allocation shall be presumed to be insubstantial if: (1) The amount of the allocation would increase or decrease an accounting period&amp;rsquo;s net income, as determined before the allocation, by less than ten per cent; or (2) The value of the asset producing the receipt for which the allocation would be made is less than ten per cent of the total value of the trust&amp;rsquo;s assets at the beginning of the accounting period.
