  "context": "[ยง557A-409] Deferred compensation, annuities, and similar payments. (a) This section shall apply to payments that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payor in exchange for future payments. The payments include those made in money or property from the payor&amp;rsquo;s general assets or from a separate fund created by the payor, including a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, or stock ownership plan. This section shall not apply to payments to which section 557A-410 applies. (b) To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest or a dividend or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, it shall be allocated to income. The balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, shall be allocated to principal. &amp;copy; If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten per cent of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the entire payment shall be allocated to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment shall not be &amp;ldquo;required to be made&amp;rdquo; to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal. (d) If, to obtain an estate tax marital deduction for a trust, a trustee shall allocate more of a payment to income than provided for by this section, the trustee shall allocate to income the additional amount necessary to obtain the marital deduction.
