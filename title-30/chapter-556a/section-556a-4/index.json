(a) A user may use an online tool to direct the custodian to disclose to a designated recipient or not to disclose some or all of the user&amp;rsquo;s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications. If the online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding disclosure using an online tool overrides a contrary direction by the user in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record. (b) If a user has not used an online tool to give direction under subsection (a) or if the custodian has not provided an online tool, the user may allow or prohibit in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record, disclosure to a fiduciary of some or all of the user&amp;rsquo;s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications sent or received by the user. &amp;copy; A user&amp;rsquo;s direction under subsection (a) or (b) overrides a contrary provision in a terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from the user&amp;rsquo;s assent to the terms of service.
