<p>(b) Any employer who has received an order or citation for a serious violation of any standard or rule adopted pursuant to this chapter shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $7,700 for each violation.</p>

<p>(j) The director shall have authority to assess all civil penalties provided in this section, giving due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the business of the employer being charged, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer, and the history of previous violations.</p>

<p>(l) When an alleged violation of any provision of this chapter or any standard, rule, or order made thereunder has occurred, the department shall promptly issue a written citation, order, or notice thereof to the employer who shall be required to post the citation, order, or notice. The citation, order, or notice thereof shall include the abatement requirements and within a reasonable time the employer shall be advised of the proposed sanctions, including proposed penalties. Whenever reference is made to posting of any citation, order, notice, petition, decision, or any other type of document issued by the director under this chapter and rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, the employer shall post copies of the document at the work site involved or affected and at the place or places where notices to the employees involved are normally posted. Where posting starts the time for notice of action to or for appeal by employees under this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter, the document shall be posted by the employer upon receipt or on the next business day following receipt.</p>

<p>(m) Whoever knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $11,000, or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both.</p>
