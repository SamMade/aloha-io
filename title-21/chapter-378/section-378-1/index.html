<p>Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation where the fifteen year span of time between plaintiff&rsquo;s 1985 discrimination complaint and the adverse employment action of the case was too long to permit a causal connection to be inferred between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. 119 H. 288 (App.), 196 P.3d 290 (2008).</p>

Employment does not include services by an individual employed as a domestic in the home of any person, except as provided in section 378-2(a)(9).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Employment agency&rdquo; means any person engaged in the business of providing employment information, procuring employment for applicants, or providing employees for placement with employers upon request.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Individuals are subject to liability under §378-2 when they act as agents of an employer. 396 F. Supp. 2d 1138 (2005).</p>

<p>Based on the plain language of this section and §378-2(2), plaintiff may not proceed under §378-2(2) against defendant, an individual employee. 405 F. Supp. 2d 1225 (2005).</p>

<p>The Hawaii supreme court in French did not demonstrate a clear attempt to keep Hawaii law distinct from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) such that a claim under the Hawaii discrimination law raises issues sufficiently distinct from an ADA claim so as to prevent application of the first-to-file-rule. 728 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (2010).</p>

<p>Based on the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in this section, legislature intended all employers, regardless of size, to be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104 (1999).</p>

<p>The issue of whether a plaintiff&rsquo;s major life activity is substantially limited must be resolved on a case-by-case basis; thus, the determination of whether the lifting restriction on employee was substantial required an individualized inquiry that was inappropriate for summary judgment. 105 H. 462, 99 P.3d 1046 (2004).</p>
