The employer&amp;rsquo;s election is binding for one year. (b) Whether the employer elects a plan type described in subsection (a)(1) or in subsection (a)(2), the employer may elect the particular contractor but the employee shall not be obligated to contribute a greater amount to the premium than the employee would have to contribute had the employer elected coverage with the contractor providing the prevailing coverage of the respective type in the State.
