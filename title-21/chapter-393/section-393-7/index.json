  "context": "§393-7 Required health care benefits. (a) A prepaid health care plan shall qualify as a plan providing the mandatory health care benefits required under this chapter if it provides for health care benefits equal to, or medically reasonably substitutable for, the benefits provided by prepaid health plans of the same type, as specified in section 393-12(a)(1) or (2), which have the largest numbers of subscribers in the State. This applies to the types and quantity of benefits as well as to limitations on reimbursability, including deductibles, and to required amounts of co-insurance.

Coverage under a plan which provides aggregate benefits that are more limited than those provided by plans qualifying under subsection (a) shall be in compliance with section 393-11 only if the employer contributes at least half of the cost of the coverage of dependents under such plan. &amp;copy; Subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) without limiting the development of medically more desirable combinations and the inclusion of new types of benefits, a prepaid health care plan qualifying under this chapter shall include at least the following benefit types: (1) Hospital benefits: (A) In-patient care for a period of at least one hundred twenty days of confinement in each calendar year covering: (i) Room accommodations; (ii) Regular and special diets; (iii) General nursing services; (iv) Use of operating room, surgical supplies, anesthesia services, and supplies; (v) Drugs, dressings, oxygen, antibiotics, and blood transfusion services; (B) Out-patient care: (i) Covering use of out-patient hospital; (ii) Facilities for surgical procedures or medical care of an emergency and urgent nature.

Medical treatment of substance abuse shall not be limited or reduced by restricting coverage to the mental health or psychiatric benefits of a plan. However, any psychiatric services received as a result of the treatment of substance abuse may be limited to the psychiatric benefits of the plan; (B) Out-patient benefits provided by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist, without restriction as to place of service; provided that health plans of the type specified in section 393-12(a) shall retain for the contractor the option of: (i) Providing the benefits in its own facility and utilizing its own staff; (ii) Contracting for the provision of these benefits; or (iii) Authorizing the patient to utilize outside services and defraying or reimbursing the expenses at a rate not to exceed that for provision of services utilizing the health contractor&amp;rsquo;s own facilities and staff; &amp;copy; Detoxification and acute care benefits in a hospital or any other public or private treatment facility, or portion thereof, providing services especially for the detoxification of intoxicated persons or drug addicts, which is appropriately licensed, certified, or approved by the department of health in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.
