  "context": "§387-10 Oaths; affidavits; subpoenas; witnesses; immunities. The director of labor and industrial relations or the director&amp;rsquo;s authorized representative may administer oaths, take or cause to be taken the depositions of witnesses, and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, records, and other evidence relative to any matter under investigation. The subpoena shall be signed and issued by the director or the director&amp;rsquo;s authorized representative. In cases of failure of any person to comply with any subpoena lawfully issued under this section or on the refusal of any witness to produce evidence or to testify to any matter regarding which the witness may be lawfully interrogated, any circuit court, or the judge thereof, upon the application of the director or the director&amp;rsquo;s authorized representative, shall compel obedience by proceedings for contempt, as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued by the court or a refusal to testify therein. The director may certify to official acts. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records and documents before the director or the director&amp;rsquo;s authorized representative, or in obedience to the subpoena of the director or the director&amp;rsquo;s authorized representative, or in any cause or proceeding instituted under this chapter, on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture; but no individual shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which the individual is compelled to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, after having claimed the individual&amp;rsquo;s privilege against self-incrimination, except that the individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.
