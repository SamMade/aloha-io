An employer to whom the department has sent a request for wage and employment information for an employee claiming benefits against the trust fund for disability benefits, shall complete and file such information within seven days from date the request was sent. If an employer fails to file such information in seven days, the director shall levy a penalty of not more than $10 for each delinquent request, unless the failure to file such information is excused by the director after a showing by such employer that such filing could not be made on the prescribed date therefor owing to conditions over which the employer had no control.
