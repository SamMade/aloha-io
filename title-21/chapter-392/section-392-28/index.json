(4) Indemnity payments for wage loss under any applicable employers&amp;rsquo; liability law of this State, or of any other state or of the United States. If an employee has received benefits under this chapter for a period of disability for which the employee is entitled to such indemnity payments, any insurer or employer or the trust fund for disability benefits providing such benefits shall be subrogated to the employee&amp;rsquo;s right to such indemnity payments in the amount of the benefits paid under this chapter as hereinafter provided.
