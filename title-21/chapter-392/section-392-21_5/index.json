  "context": "§392-21.5 Proceedings to determine employment and coverage. The director of labor and industrial relations shall have original jurisdiction over all controversies and disputes over employment and coverage under this chapter. Except in cases where services are specifically and expressly excluded from &amp;ldquo;employment&amp;rdquo; under section 392-5, it shall be presumed that coverage applies unless the party seeking exclusion is able to establish under both the control test and the relative nature of the work test that coverage is not appropriate under this chapter. There shall be a right of appeal from decisions of the director to the circuit court and thence to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602. [L 1996, c 94, §2; am L 2004, c 202, §46; am L 2006, c 94, §1; am L 2010, c 109, §1] "
