If an employer or insurer fails to pay the assessment required by section 392-67(a) or section 392-67(b) within thirty days after the end of the month or quarter for which payment was due, the director shall levy a penalty of at least $10 but no more than ten per cent of the assessment due against such employer or insurer, unless the nonpayment is excused by the director after a showing by such employer or insurer that the payment of the assessment could not be made on the date prescribed therefor owing to conditions over which the employer or insurer had no control and such employer or insurer forthwith complies.
