The fund&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to sell workers&amp;rsquo; compensation insurance at the lowest actuarially responsible price as determined by the fund&amp;rsquo;s board. The fund shall commence operation upon appointment and qualification of the initial five members of the fund&amp;rsquo;s board, but the workers&amp;rsquo; compensation insurance sold initially by the fund shall provide insurance coverage for work injuries occurring from a date to be established by the board and not more than one year from the date of the appointment and qualification. The fund may serve as a model for the workers&amp;rsquo; compensation insurance industry to determine minimum insurance premium rates. It shall be competitive with other private workers&amp;rsquo; compensation insurance carriers. [L 1985, c 296, pt of ยง11; am L 1989, c 277, ยง4] "
