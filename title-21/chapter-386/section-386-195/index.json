(a) The certificate of approval issued by the insurance commissioner to a workers&amp;rsquo; compensation self-insurance group authorizes the group to provide workers&amp;rsquo; compensation benefits. The certificate of approval shall remain in effect until terminated at the request of the group or revoked by the insurance commissioner pursuant to section 386-211. (b) The insurance commissioner shall not grant the request of any group to terminate its certificate of approval unless the group has insured or reinsured all incurred workers&amp;rsquo; compensation obligations with an authorized insurer under an agreement filed with and approved in writing by the insurance commissioner. The obligations shall include both known claims and expenses associated therewith and claims incurred, but not reported, and expenses associated therewith. &amp;copy; Subject to the approval of the insurance commissioner, a group may merge with another group engaged in the same or similar type of business only if the resulting group assumes in full all obligations of the merging groups. The insurance commissioner may hold a hearing on the merger and shall do so if any party, including a member of either group, so requests. [L 1986, c 304, pt of ยง1] "
