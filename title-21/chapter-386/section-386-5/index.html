<p>Where employer newspaper hired newspaper carrier as &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo; under the express terms of employers own agreement, employer was estopped from claiming tort protection under this section unless and until injured carrier challenged the form-over-substance nature of the agreement and was awarded workers compensation benefits by the director or appeals board. 89 H. 411, 974 P.2d 51 (1999).</p>

<p>Where plaintiff&rsquo;s claims did not arise under this chapter, the exclusive remedy and original jurisdiction provisions in the workers&rsquo; compensation statute did not apply, and where plaintiff&rsquo;s claims for relief of tortious conduct on the part of workers&rsquo; compensation insurer were not within the original jurisdiction of the labor director, trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that basis. 90 H. 407, 978 P.2d 845 (1999).</p>

<p>Section bars neither a minor&rsquo;s tort claims for the minor&rsquo;s in utero injuries, nor any otherwise valid claims of any other party that allegedly derive from minor&rsquo;s injuries. 91 H. 146, 981 P.2d 703 (1999).</p>

<p>The exclusive remedy provision of the workers&rsquo; compensation law does not bar claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress related to sexual harassment. 97 H. 376, 38 P.3d 95 (2001).</p>

<p>Where law firm&rsquo;s actions as an employer and law firm were not inconsistent and law firm&rsquo;s status as an employer and law firm involved a single legal entity for purposes of the &ldquo;dual persona&rdquo; doctrine, trial court did not err in granting law firm&rsquo;s motion to dismiss terminated attorney&rsquo;s negligent investigation claim. 117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91 (2008).</p>

<p>Where this section unambiguously provides that claims for infliction of emotional distress or invasion of privacy are not subject to the exclusivity provision when such claims arise from claims for sexual harassment or sexual assault, in which case a civil action may be brought, and plaintiff alleged a claim for emotional distress (negligent investigation) that did not arise out of sexual harassment or sexual assault, such claim was, pursuant to this section, barred. 117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91 (2008).</p>

<p>An employee may bring action against employer for intentional infliction of emotional distress caused by discrimination in violation of §378-2, and this action is not barred by exclusivity provision of this section. 87 H. 57 (App.), 951 P.2d 507 (1998).</p>

<p>Where record revealed that the parties disputed at least two material facts&ndash;whose work was being done by plaintiff when plaintiff was injured and who controlled plaintiff&rsquo;s work at the job site&ndash;defendant failed to produce evidence that defendant was a &ldquo;statutory employer&rdquo; for workers&rsquo; compensation purposes; thus, circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to defendant because defendant had not demonstrated that it was immune from suit and was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 124 H. 230 (App.), 239 P.3d 1280 (2010).</p>

<p>This section and the workers&rsquo; compensation law as a whole mandated the conclusion that the workers&rsquo; compensation remedies granted to employee excluded all other liabilities of employer to employee on account of personal injuries employee allegedly suffered arising out of and in the course of employee&rsquo;s employment; also, §386-8 and this section did not allow employee to pursue suit against the employer for the alleged wilful and wanton misconduct of employee&rsquo;s fellow employees acting in the course and scope of their employment. 128 H. 173 (App.), 284 P.3d 946 (2012).</p>

<p>Cited: 23 H. 291, 294 (1916); 56 H. 544, 545 P.2d 687 (1976).</p>

<p>Where the plaintiffs alleged damages resulting from exposure to a chemical pesticide allegedly manufactured or utilized by the employers, the workers&rsquo; compensation law was the exclusive remedy for claims against the employers for the alleged injuries. Also, more than one employing entity can claim the liability protection of the exclusivity provision in this section. 132 H. 478 (App.), 323 P.3d 122 (2014).</p>

<p>Where the plaintiffs proposed an amended complaint that no longer alleged that the defendants were the plaintiffs&rsquo; employers, taking the amended allegations as true, the workers&rsquo; compensation law would not bar the claims against the defendants. 132 H. 478 (App.), 323 P.3d 122 (2014).</p>
