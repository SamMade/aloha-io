  "context": "§386-4 Voluntary coverage. Any employer who has individuals in the employer&amp;rsquo;s employment who are not employees as defined in section 386-1 may elect to provide coverage for them under this chapter. During the period for which the election is effective the employer and the individuals in the employer&amp;rsquo;s employment covered thereby shall be deemed to be employees and be subject in all respects to this chapter. Election by any employer to provide coverage under this chapter shall be made by securing compensation to the individuals in the employer&amp;rsquo;s employment affected thereby in the manner provided in section 386-121 and giving the notice prescribed by section 386-122. Every employer who elects to provide coverage under the terms of this section shall be bound by the election until January 1 of the next succeeding year and for terms of one year thereafter. Any such employer may elect to discontinue the coverage for personal injuries occurring after the expiration of any such calendar year by filing notice of the election with the director of labor and industrial relations at least sixty days prior to the expiration of any such calendar year and at the same time posting notices to that effect conspicuously in such places of work that they can reasonably be expected to come to the attention of all individuals affected thereby.
