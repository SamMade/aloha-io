<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Under paragraph (9)(B), eligibility of a student-employee for unemployment insurance benefits rests on whether the &ldquo;primary relationship&rdquo; the student occupies with respect to the school, college, or university involved is that of student or employee; under circumstances of the case, the primary relationship claimant had to the university while claimant performed services during the summer was that of a student of the university. 105 H. 485, 100 P.3d 55 (2004).</p>
