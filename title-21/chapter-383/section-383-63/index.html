Whenever there was or is a change in the definition of &ldquo;employment&rdquo; or in the definition of &ldquo;wages&rdquo;, effective for the purposes of this chapter generally or of this part at the commencement of or at a date within the three-year period of any average annual payroll, &ldquo;employment&rdquo; and &ldquo;wages&rdquo; for the purpose of determining each annual payroll within such period and the average annual payroll for such period, shall have the meaning prior to the effective date of such change which they had in accordance with this chapter then in effect and shall have the meaning after the effective date of such change assigned to them by the amendment to this chapter providing for such change.</p>
