<p>(ii) Has not received and is not seeking unemployment benefits under the unemployment compensation law of the Virgin Islands or of Canada; but if the individual is seeking such benefits and the appropriate agency finally determines that the individual is not entitled to benefits under such law the individual is considered an exhaustee; provided that this provision shall not be applicable to benefits under the Virgin Islands law beginning on the day after the day on which the United States Secretary of Labor approves under section 3304(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 an unemployment compensation law submitted by the Virgin Islands for approval.</p>
