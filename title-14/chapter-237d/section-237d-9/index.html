      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Assessment of tax upon failure to make return; limitation period; exceptions; extension by agreement</h2>
      <p><strong>§237D-9 Assessment of tax upon failure to make return; limitation period; exceptions; extension by agreement.</strong> (a) If any operator or plan manager fails to make a return as required by this chapter, the director shall make an estimate of the tax liability of the operator or plan manager from any information the director obtains, and according to the estimate so made, assess the taxes, interest, and penalty due the State from the operator or plan manager, give notice of the assessment to the operator or plan manager, and make demand upon the operator or plan manager for payment. The assessment shall be presumed to be correct until and unless, upon an appeal duly taken as provided in section 237D-11, the contrary shall be clearly proved by the person assessed, and the burden of proof upon such appeal shall be upon the person assessed to disprove the correctness of assessment.</p>

<p>(b) After a return is filed under this chapter the director shall cause the return to be examined, and may make such further audits or investigation as the director considers necessary. If the director determines that there is a deficiency with respect to the payment of any tax due under this chapter, the director shall assess the taxes and interest due the State, give notice of the assessment to the persons liable, and make demand upon the persons for payment.</p>

<p>&copy; Except as otherwise provided by this section, the amount of taxes imposed by this chapter shall be assessed or levied within three years after the annual return was filed, or within three years of the due date prescribed for the filing of the return, whichever is later, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of any of the taxes shall be begun after the expiration of the period. Where the assessment of the tax imposed by this chapter has been made within the period of limitation applicable thereto, the tax may be collected by levy or by a proceeding in court under chapter 231; provided that the levy is made or the proceeding was begun within fifteen years after the assessment of the tax. For any tax that has been assessed prior to July 1, 2009, the levy or proceeding shall be barred after June 30, 2024.</p>

<p><a></a>Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this section, the limitation on collection after assessment in this section shall be suspended for the period:</p>

<p><a></a>(1) The taxpayer agrees to suspend the period;</p>

<p><a></a>(2) The assets of the taxpayer are in control or custody of a court in any proceeding before any court of the United States or any state, and for six months thereafter;</p>

<p><a></a>(3) An offer in compromise under section 231-3(10) is pending; and</p>

<p><a></a>(4) During which the taxpayer is outside the State if the period of absence is for a continuous period of at least six months; provided that if at the time of the taxpayer&rsquo;s return to the State the period of limitations on collection after assessment would expire before the expiration of six months from the date of the taxpayer&rsquo;s return, the period shall not expire before the expiration of the six months.</p>

<p>(d) In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax, or of a failure to file the annual return, the tax may be assessed or levied at any time; provided that the burden of proof with respect to the issues of falsity or fraud and intent to evade tax shall be upon the State.</p>

<p>(e) Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed in subsection &copy;, both the department of taxation and the taxpayer have consented in writing to the assessment or levy of the tax after the date fixed by subsection &copy;, the tax may be assessed or levied at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. [L 1986, c 340, pt of §1; am L 1988, c 241, §9; am L 1993, c 257, §3; am L 1998, c 156, §24; am L 2009, c 166, §8]</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>Applicability of 2009 amendment. L 2009, c 166, §27.</p>
