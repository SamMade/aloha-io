If a request for extension of time to file the federal return is denied by the Internal Revenue Service, no penalty shall be due under this chapter if the return required by this chapter is filed within the time specified by the Internal Revenue Service for filing the federal return. If a request for extension of time to pay the federal transfer tax is denied by the Internal Revenue Service, no penalty shall be due under this chapter if the tax is paid within the time specified by the Internal Revenue Service for paying the federal transfer tax.
