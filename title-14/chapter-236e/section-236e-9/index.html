      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Returns; time to file return and pay tax</h2>
      <p><strong>[ยง236E-9] Returns; time to file return and pay tax.</strong> (a) The Hawaii transfer tax return, including any supplemental or amended return, is required to be filed pursuant to this chapter whenever a federal estate tax return or applicable generation-skipping transfer tax return is required to be filed. The return shall be filed, and the Hawaii transfer tax, including any additional tax that may become due, shall be paid by the same person or persons, respectively, who are required to pay the federal transfer tax and file the federal return, including any duly authorized executor or administrator. If there is more than one executor or administrator, the return shall be made jointly by all. If there is no executor or administrator appointed, qualified, and acting, each person in actual or constructive possession of any property of the decedent is constituted an executor for purposes of the tax and shall make and file a return. If in any case the executor is unable to make a complete return as to any part of the gross estate, the executor shall provide all the information available to the executor with respect to the property, including a full description and the name of every person holding a legal or beneficial interest in the property. If the executor is unable to make a return as to any property, each person holding a legal or equitable interest in the property shall, upon notice from the department, make a return as to that part of the gross estate.</p>

<p>(b) The executed Hawaii transfer tax return shall be filed with the department on or before the date the federal estate tax return or applicable generation-skipping transfer tax return is required to be filed, including any extension of time for filing the federal estate tax return or applicable generation-skipping transfer tax return.</p>

<p>&copy;(1) The personal representative, without assessment, notice, or demand, shall pay any tax due thereon to the department on or before the date fixed for filing the return, out of any moneys belonging to the estate in the personal representative&rsquo;s hands; and</p>

<p>(2) The personal representative shall have the same powers and duties with respect to the raising of funds for the payment of the tax as conferred upon an executor under sections 2205, 2206, 2207, 2207A, and 2207B of the Internal Revenue Code, and pursuant to the laws of the State in the case of raising funds for the payment of a decedent&rsquo;s debts generally. Any provision in a decedent&rsquo;s will or revocable trust in which a decedent effectively waives a right of recovery under a section of the Internal Revenue Code specified in this paragraph shall be deemed a waiver of the corresponding right of recovery under this section, unless the will or revocable trust specifically states otherwise.</p>

<p>(d) For the purposes of this chapter, the timely filing of any tax return, claim, statement, report, or other document required or authorized to be filed with, or the timeliness of any payment made to, the department and any notice required or authorized to be given by the department shall be governed by chapter 231.</p>

<p>(e) If any portion of the federal transfer tax is deferred or to be paid in installments under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the portion of the Hawaii transfer tax that is subject to deferral or payable in installments shall be determined by multiplying the Hawaii transfer tax by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross value of the assets included in the transferred property having a tax situs in the State and that give rise to the deferred or installment payment under the Internal Revenue Code, and the denominator of which is the gross value of all assets included in the transferred property having a tax situs in the State.</p>

<p>Deferred payments and installment payments, with interest, shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as payments of the federal transfer tax are required to be made under the applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code; provided that the rate of interest on unpaid amounts of Hawaii transfer tax shall be determined under this chapter.</p>

<p>Acceleration of payment under this section shall occur under the same circumstances and in the same manner as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<p>(f) No return shall be required to be filed unless a federal estate tax return or applicable generation-skipping transfer tax return is required to be filed. [L 2012, c 220, pt of ยง1]</p>
