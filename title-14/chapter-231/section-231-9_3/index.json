The United States government is requested to provide the information necessary to ascertain the names and work dates of United States mainland contractors working on federal projects. The director of taxation shall work with the United States government to establish this information to enforce and collect taxes owed to the State. The director of taxation may contract with bonded collection agencies, licensed attorneys, accountants, auditors, or other persons to pursue and collect claims of the State when the mainland contractor, who owes delinquent general excise taxes or is subject to other provisions under chapter 231, has moved back to the United States mainland. The director of taxation may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to implement this section. [L 2001, c 206, ยง2] Revision Note Subsection designation deleted pursuant to ยง23G-15(1). "
