Sections 231-34, 231-35, 231-36, and 231-36.4 shall be construed in accordance with judicial interpretations given to similar provisions of title 26 of the United States Code; consistent therewith, the term &amp;ldquo;wilfully&amp;rdquo; shall mean a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty. [L 1995, c 92, pt of §2; am L 2009, c 166, §22; am L 2011, c 43, §3] Case Notes Where, pursuant to this section, the Cheek interpretation of the wilfulness requirement&amp;ndash;that a jury must be permitted to consider evidence of a defendant&amp;rsquo;s good faith belief that defendant&amp;rsquo;s conduct did not violate the tax laws, even if that belief was not objectively reasonable, in determining whether defendant acted wilfully&amp;ndash;was adopted and applied in construing §231-36(a), the trial court erred in excluding defendant&amp;rsquo;s exhibit pursuant to HRE rules 401 and 403 on the grounds that defendant&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the tax laws was irrelevant and that evidence of defendant&amp;rsquo;s legal theories would confuse the jury. 119 H. 60 (App.), 193 P.3d 1260 (2008).
