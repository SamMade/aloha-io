For purposes of this paragraph, an amount has been substantially underreported if the amount properly includible on the return or submission is in excess of twenty-five per cent of the amount stated on the return or submission; (2) Is required to be licensed, registered, or permitted under title 14 and is in fact not so licensed, registered, or permitted; (3) Has a past pattern of noncompliance of obligations under title 14; (4) Does not have a fixed and permanent principal place of business; (5) Has not obtained any required tax clearance; (6) Has failed to maintain adequate books and records, or those records required to be maintained by law or administrative rule; (7) Does not accept checks or electronic payment devices for business transactions; provided that a business may establish reasonable criteria for accepting personal checks; (8) Offers price differentials or otherwise deviates from usual business practices when the business transaction substantially involves payment of cash, except where there is a bona fide business reason for a price differential, such as the avoidance of merchant fees imposed by credit card companies; or (9) Any other factor relevant to describing a cash-based business capable of noncompliance as determined by the director of taxation and issued pursuant to a tax information release; provided that a business shall not be deemed to have met any of these factors while a genuine dispute as to that factor is pending in a contested case before any administrative agency or in any court.
