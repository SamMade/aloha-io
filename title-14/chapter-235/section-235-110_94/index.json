L 2016, c 258, §5.] (a) There shall be allowed to each qualified taxpayer subject to the tax imposed under this chapter, an income tax credit that shall be deductible from the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed. (b) The amount of the tax credit shall be equal to the qualified expenses of the qualified taxpayer, up to a maximum of $50,000. &amp;copy; In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualified expenses incurred by the entity for the taxable year. The expenses upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level. Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rule. (d) The total amount of tax credits allowed under this section shall not exceed $2,000,000 for all qualified taxpayers in any taxable year; provided that any taxpayer who is not eligible to claim the credit in a taxable year due to the $2,000,000 cap having been exceeded for that taxable year shall be eligible to claim the credit in the subsequent taxable year. (e) Every qualified taxpayer, before March 31 of each year in which qualified expenses were incurred by the taxpayer in the previous taxable year, shall submit a written, certified statement to the chairperson of the board of agriculture identifying: (1) Qualified expenses incurred in the previous taxable year; and (2) The amount of the tax credit claimed by the taxpayer pursuant to this section, if any, in the previous taxable year.

(h) If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s net income tax liability, the excess of the credit over liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s net income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted. All claims for the tax credit under this section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.
