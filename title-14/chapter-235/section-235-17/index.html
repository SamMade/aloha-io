      <p><strong>ยง235-17 Motion picture, digital media, and film production income tax credit.</strong> <em>[Repeal and reenactment on January 1, 2019. L 2013, c 89, ยง3.]</em> (a) Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter, an income tax credit that shall be deductible from the taxpayer&rsquo;s net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed. The amount of the credit shall be:</p>

<p>(1) Twenty per cent of the qualified production costs incurred by a qualified production in any county of the State with a population of over seven hundred thousand; or</p>

<p>(2) Twenty-five per cent of the qualified production costs incurred by a qualified production in any county of the State with a population of seven hundred thousand or less.</p>

<p>A qualified production occurring in more than one county may prorate its expenditures based upon the amounts spent in each county, if the population bases differ enough to change the percentage of tax credit.</p>

<p>In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualified production costs incurred by the entity for the taxable year. The cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level. Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rule.</p>

<p>If a deduction is taken under section 179 (with respect to election to expense depreciable business assets) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, no tax credit shall be allowed for those costs for which the deduction is taken.</p>

<p>The basis for eligible property for depreciation of accelerated cost recovery system purposes for state income taxes shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowable and claimed.</p>

<p>(b) The credit allowed under this section shall be claimed against the net income tax liability for the taxable year. For the purposes of this section, &ldquo;net income tax liability&rdquo; means net income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter.</p>

<p>&copy; If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer&rsquo;s income tax liability, the excess of credits over liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1. All claims, including any amended claims, for tax credits under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed. Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</p>

<p>(d) To qualify for this tax credit, a production shall:</p>

<p>(1) Meet the definition of a qualified production specified in subsection (l);</p>

<p>(2) Have qualified production costs totaling at least $200,000;</p>

<p>(3) Provide the State, at a minimum, a shared-card, end-title screen credit, where applicable;</p>

<p>(4) Provide evidence of reasonable efforts to hire local talent and crew; and</p>

<p>(5) Provide evidence of financial or in-kind contributions or educational or workforce development efforts, in partnership with related local industry labor organizations, educational institutions, or both, toward the furtherance of the local film and television and digital media industries.</p>

<p>(e) On or after July 1, 2006, no qualified production cost that has been financed by investments for which a credit was claimed by any taxpayer pursuant to section 235-110.9 is eligible for credits under this section.</p>

<p>(f) To receive the tax credit, the taxpayer shall first prequalify the production for the credit by registering with the department of business, economic development, and tourism during the development or preproduction stage. Failure to comply with this provision may constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</p>

<p>(g) The director of taxation shall prepare forms as may be necessary to claim a credit under this section. The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.</p>

<p>(h) Every taxpayer claiming a tax credit under this section for a qualified production shall, no later than ninety days following the end of each taxable year in which qualified production costs were expended, submit a written, sworn statement to the department of business, economic development, and tourism, identifying:</p>

<p>(1) All qualified production costs as provided by subsection (a), if any, incurred in the previous taxable year;</p>

<p>(2) The amount of tax credits claimed pursuant to this section, if any, in the previous taxable year; and</p>

<p>(3) The number of total hires versus the number of local hires by category and by county.</p>

<p>This information may be reported from the department of business, economic development, and tourism to the legislature in redacted form pursuant to subsection (i)(4).</p>

<p>(i) The department of business, economic development, and tourism shall:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain records of the names of the taxpayers and qualified productions thereof claiming the tax credits under subsection (a);</p>

<p>(2) Obtain and total the aggregate amounts of all qualified production costs per qualified production and per qualified production per taxable year;</p>

<p>(3) Provide a letter to the director of taxation specifying the amount of the tax credit per qualified production for each taxable year that a tax credit is claimed and the cumulative amount of the tax credit for all years claimed; and</p>

<p>(4) Submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session detailing the non-aggregated qualified production costs that form the basis of the tax credit claims and expenditures, itemized by taxpayer, in a redacted format to preserve the confidentiality of the taxpayers claiming the credit.</p>

<p>Upon each determination required under this subsection, the department of business, economic development, and tourism shall issue a letter to the taxpayer, regarding the qualified production, specifying the qualified production costs and the tax credit amount qualified for in each taxable year a tax credit is claimed. The taxpayer for each qualified production shall file the letter with the taxpayer&rsquo;s tax return for the qualified production to the department of taxation. Notwithstanding the authority of the department of business, economic development, and tourism under this section, the director of taxation may audit and adjust the tax credit amount to conform to the information filed by the taxpayer.</p>
