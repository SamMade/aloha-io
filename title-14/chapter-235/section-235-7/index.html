<p>(6) Any income expressly exempted or excluded from the measure of the tax imposed by this chapter by any other law of the State, it being the intent of this chapter not to repeal or supersede any express exemption or exclusion;</p>

<p>(7) Income received by each member of the reserve components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States of America, and the Hawaii National Guard as compensation for performance of duty, equivalent to pay received for forty-eight drills (equivalent of twelve weekends) and fifteen days of annual duty, at an:</p>

<p>(9) The value of legal services provided by a legal service plan to a taxpayer, the taxpayer&rsquo;s spouse, and the taxpayer&rsquo;s dependents;</p>

<p>(10) Amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by a legal service plan to a taxpayer as payment or reimbursement for the provision of legal services to the taxpayer, the taxpayer&rsquo;s spouse, and the taxpayer&rsquo;s dependents;</p>

<p>(11) Contributions by an employer to a legal service plan for compensation (through insurance or otherwise) to the employer&rsquo;s employees for the costs of legal services incurred by the employer&rsquo;s employees, their spouses, and their dependents;</p>

<p>(12) Amounts received in the form of a monthly surcharge by a utility acting on behalf of an affected utility under section 269-16.3; provided that amounts retained by the acting utility for collection or other costs shall not be included in this exemption;</p>

<p>(13) Amounts received in the form of a cable surcharge by an electric utility company acting on behalf of a certified cable company under section 269-134; provided that any amounts retained by that electric utility company for collection or other costs shall not be included in this exemption; and</p>

<p>For purposes of this paragraph:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fee simple owner&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as provided under section 516-1; provided that it shall include legal and equitable owners;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Legal and equitable owner&rdquo;, and &ldquo;leased fee interest&rdquo; shall have the same meanings as provided under section 516-1; and</p>

<p>&ldquo;Condominium project&rdquo; and &ldquo;cooperative project&rdquo; shall have the same meanings as provided under section 514C-1.</p>

<p>(b) There shall be included in gross income, adjusted gross income, and taxable income:</p>

<p>(1) Unless excluded by this chapter relating to the uniformed services of the United States, cost-of-living allowances and other payments exempted by section 912 of the Internal Revenue Code, but section 119 of the Internal Revenue Code nevertheless shall apply; and</p>

<p>(2) Unless expressly exempted or excluded as provided by subsection (a)(6), interest on the obligations of a State or a political subdivision thereof.</p>

<p>&copy; The deductions of or based on dividends paid or received, allowed to a corporation under chapter 1, subchapter B, part VIII of the Internal Revenue Code, shall not be allowed. In lieu thereof there shall be allowed as a deduction the entire amount of dividends received by any corporation upon the shares of stock of a national banking association, qualifying dividends, as defined in section 243(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, received by members of an affiliated group, or dividends received by a small business investment company operating under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (Public Law 85-699) upon shares of stock qualifying under paragraph (3), seventy per cent of the amount received by any corporation as dividends:</p>

<p>(1) Upon the shares of stock of another corporation, if at the date of payment of the dividend at least ninety-five per cent of the other corporation&rsquo;s capital stock is owned by one or more corporations doing business in this State and if the other corporation is subjected to an income tax in another jurisdiction (but subjection to federal tax does not constitute subjection to income tax in another jurisdiction); and</p>

<p>(2) Upon the shares of stock of a bank or insurance company organized and doing business under the laws of the State;</p>

<p>(3) Upon the shares of stock of another corporation, if at least fifteen per cent of the latter corporation&rsquo;s business, for the taxable year of the latter corporation preceding the payment of the dividend, has been attributed to this State.</p>

<p>However, except for national bank dividends, the deductions under this subsection are not allowed when they would not have been allowed under section 243 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Public Law 85-866, by reason of subsections (b) and &copy; of section 246 of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purposes of this subsection fifteen per cent of a corporation&rsquo;s business shall be deemed to have been attributed to this State if fifteen per cent or more of the entire gross income of the corporation as defined in this chapter (which for the purposes of this subsection shall be computed without regard to source in the State and shall include income not taxable by reason of the fact that it is from property not owned in the State or from a trade or business not carried on in the State in whole or in part), under section 235-5 and the other provisions of this chapter, shall have been attributed to the State and subjected to assessment of the taxable income therefrom (including the determination of the resulting net loss, if any).</p>

<p>(d) (1) For taxable years ending before January 1, 1967, the net operating loss deductions allowed as carrybacks and carryovers by the Internal Revenue Code shall not be allowed. In lieu thereof the net operating loss deduction shall consist of the excess of the deductions allowed by this chapter over the gross income, computed with the modifications specified in paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 172(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, and with the further modification stated in paragraph (3) hereof; and shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the taxable income of the taxpayer for the succeeding taxable year;</p>

<p>(2) (A) With respect to net operating loss deductions resulting from net operating losses for taxable years ending after December 31, 1966, the net operating loss deduction provisions of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply; provided that there shall be no net operating loss deduction carried back to any taxable year ending prior to January 1, 1967;</p>

<p>(B) In the case of a taxable year beginning in 1966 and ending in 1967, the entire amount of all net operating loss deductions carried back to the taxable year shall be limited to that portion of taxable income for such taxable year which the number of days in 1967 bears to the total days in the taxable year ending in 1967; and</p>

<p>&copy; The computation of any net operating loss deduction for a taxable year covered by this subsection shall require the further modifications stated in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of this subsection;</p>

<p>(3) In computing the net operating loss deduction allowed by this subsection, there shall be included in gross income the amount of interest which is excluded from gross income by subsection (a), decreased by the amount of interest paid or accrued which is disallowed as a deduction by subsection (e). In determining the amount of the net operating loss deduction under this subsection of any corporation, there shall be disregarded the net operating loss of such corporation for any taxable year for which the corporation is an electing small business corporation;</p>

<p>(4) No net operating loss carryback or carryover shall be allowed by this chapter if not allowed under section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code;</p>

<p>(5) The election to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a net operating loss allowed under section 172(b)(3)&copy; of the Internal Revenue Code shall be operative for the purposes of this chapter; provided that no taxpayer shall make such an election as to a net operating loss of a business where such net operating loss occurred in the taxpayer&rsquo;s business prior to the taxpayer entering business in this State; and</p>

<p>(6) The five-year carryback period for net operating losses for any taxable year ending during 2001 and 2002 in section 172(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code as it read on December 31, 2008, shall not be operative for purposes of this chapter; and</p>

<p>(7) The election for the carryback for 2008 or 2009 net operating losses of small businesses as provided in section 172(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code as it read on December 31, 2009, shall not be operative for purposes of this chapter.</p>

<p>(e) There shall be disallowed as a deduction the amount of interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness incurred or continued, (1) to purchase or carry bonds the interest upon which is excluded from gross income by subsection (a); or (2) to purchase or carry property owned without the State, or to carry on trade or business without the State, if the taxpayer is a person taxable only upon income from sources in the State.</p>

<p>(f) Losses of property as the result of tidal wave, hurricane, earthquake, or volcanic eruption, or as a result of flood waters overflowing the banks or walls of a river or stream, or from any other natural disaster, to the extent of the amount deductible, under this chapter, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, may be deducted in the taxable year in which sustained, or at the option of the taxpayer may be deducted in equal installments over a period of five years, the first such year to be the calendar year or fiscal year of the taxpayer in which such loss occurred.
