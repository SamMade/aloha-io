In determining the amount of the net operating loss deduction under this subsection of any corporation, there shall be disregarded the net operating loss of such corporation for any taxable year for which the corporation is an electing small business corporation; (4) No net operating loss carryback or carryover shall be allowed by this chapter if not allowed under section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code; (5) The election to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a net operating loss allowed under section 172(b)(3)&amp;copy; of the Internal Revenue Code shall be operative for the purposes of this chapter; provided that no taxpayer shall make such an election as to a net operating loss of a business where such net operating loss occurred in the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s business prior to the taxpayer entering business in this State; and (6) The five-year carryback period for net operating losses for any taxable year ending during 2001 and 2002 in section 172(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code as it read on December 31, 2008, shall not be operative for purposes of this chapter; and (7) The election for the carryback for 2008 or 2009 net operating losses of small businesses as provided in section 172(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code as it read on December 31, 2009, shall not be operative for purposes of this chapter. (e) There shall be disallowed as a deduction the amount of interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness incurred or continued, (1) to purchase or carry bonds the interest upon which is excluded from gross income by subsection (a); or (2) to purchase or carry property owned without the State, or to carry on trade or business without the State, if the taxpayer is a person taxable only upon income from sources in the State. (f) Losses of property as the result of tidal wave, hurricane, earthquake, or volcanic eruption, or as a result of flood waters overflowing the banks or walls of a river or stream, or from any other natural disaster, to the extent of the amount deductible, under this chapter, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, may be deducted in the taxable year in which sustained, or at the option of the taxpayer may be deducted in equal installments over a period of five years, the first such year to be the calendar year or fiscal year of the taxpayer in which such loss occurred.
