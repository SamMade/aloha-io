(d) The following shall apply to certifications of vocational rehabilitation referrals: (1) An individual shall not be treated as a vocational rehabilitation referral unless, on or before the day on which the individual begins work for the employer, the employer: (A) Has received a certification from the department of human services vocational rehabilitation and services for the blind division that the individual is a qualified vocational rehabilitation referral; or (B) Has requested in writing the certification from the department of human services vocational rehabilitation and services for the blind division that the individual is a qualified vocational rehabilitation referral. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if on or before the day on which the individual begins work for the employer, the individual has received from the department of human services vocational rehabilitation and services for the blind division a written preliminary determination that the individual is a vocational rehabilitation referral, then &amp;ldquo;the fifth day&amp;rdquo; shall be substituted for &amp;ldquo;the day&amp;rdquo; in the preceding sentence. (2) If an individual has been certified as a vocational rehabilitation referral and the certification is incorrect because it was based on false information provided by the individual, the certification shall be revoked and wages paid by the employer after the date on which notice of revocation is received by the employer shall not be treated as qualified wages. (3) In any request for a certification of an individual as vocational rehabilitation referral, the employer shall certify that a good faith effort was made to determine that such individual is a vocational rehabilitation referral.

(3) No wages shall be taken into account under this section with respect to any vocational rehabilitation referral unless such individual either: (A) Is employed by the employer at least ninety days; or (B) Has completed at least one hundred-twenty hours of services performed for the employer. (f) In the case of a successor employer referred to in section 3306(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, the determination of the amount of the tax credit allowable under this section with respect to wages paid by the successor employer shall be made in the same manner as if the wages were paid by the predecessor employer referred to in the section. (g) No credit shall be determined under this section with respect to wages paid by an employer to a vocational rehabilitation referral for services performed by the individual for another person unless the amount reasonably expected to be received by the employer for the services from the other person exceeds the wages paid by the employer to the individual for such services. (h) The credit allowed under this section shall be claimed against net income tax liability for the taxable year. A tax credit under this section which exceeds the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s income tax liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted. (i) All claims for tax credits under this section, including any amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credits may be claimed. Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.

(k) The director of taxation may adopt any rules under chapter 91 and forms necessary to carry out this section.
