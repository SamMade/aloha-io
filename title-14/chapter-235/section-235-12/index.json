  "context": "§235-12 Energy conservation; income tax credit. (a) For taxable years ending before January 1, 1990, except in the case of ice storage systems for taxable years ending before January 1, 1991, each individual and corporate resident taxpayer who files an individual or corporate net income tax return for a taxable year, may claim a tax credit under this section against the Hawaii state individual or corporate net income tax. The tax credit may be claimed for any solar or wind energy device, heat pump, or ice storage system in an amount not to exceed ten per cent of the total cost of the device, heat pump, or ice storage system; provided that the tax credit shall apply only to the actual cost of the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system, their accessories, and installation and shall not include the cost of consumer incentive premiums unrelated to the operation of the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system offered with the sale of the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system. The credit shall be claimed against net income tax liability for the year in which the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system was purchased and placed in use; provided: (1) The tax credit shall be applicable only with respect to solar devices, which are erected and placed in service after December 31, 1974, but before January 1, 1990; (2) In the case of wind energy devices and heat pumps, the tax credit shall be applicable only with respect to wind energy devices and heat pumps which are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1980, but before January 1, 1990; and (3) In the case of ice storage systems, the tax credit shall be applicable only with respect to ice storage systems which are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1985, but before January 1, 1990. Tax credits which exceed the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s income tax liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted. If federal energy tax credits are not extended beyond December 31, 1985, are not retroactively extended or reenacted, or federal energy tax credits the same as or less in amount than the credits in effect during the 1985 taxable year are not enacted during the taxable year 1986, then the state tax credit shall be increased to fifteen per cent of the total cost after December 31, 1985, but before January 1, 1990. As used in this subsection: &amp;ldquo;Solar or wind energy device&amp;rdquo; means any new identifiable facility, equipment, apparatus, or the like which makes use of solar or wind energy for heating, cooling, or reducing the use of other types of energy dependent upon fossil fuel for their generation. &amp;ldquo;Heat pump&amp;rdquo; means and refers to an electric powered compression heating system which extracts energy from warm ambient air or recovers waste heat to assist in the production of hot water. &amp;ldquo;Ice storage system&amp;rdquo; refers to ice banks or other cool energy storage tanks, containers, accessories, and controls that are specifically designed to store ice or chilled fluids for the express purpose of shifting the consumption of energy to off-peak periods. (b) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1989, each individual or corporate resident taxpayer who files an individual or corporate net income tax return for a taxable year, may claim a tax credit under this section against the Hawaii state individual or corporate net income tax. The tax credit may be claimed as follows: (1) For wind energy systems that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1989, but before July 1, 2003, the credit shall be twenty per cent of the actual cost; (2) For solar energy systems that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1989, but before July 1, 2003, on new and existing single family residential buildings, the credit shall be in an amount not to exceed thirty-five per cent or $1,750, whichever is less, of the actual cost of the solar energy system; (3) For solar energy systems that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1989, but before July 1, 2003, on new and existing multiunit buildings used primarily for residential purposes, the credit shall be in an amount not to exceed thirty-five per cent or $350 per building unit, whichever is less, of the actual cost of the solar energy system; (4) For solar energy systems that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1989, but before July 1, 2003, in new and existing hotel, commercial, and industrial facilities, the credit shall be in an amount not to exceed thirty-five per cent of the actual cost of the solar energy system; (5) For heat pumps that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1989, but before July 1, 2003, in new and existing single-family residential buildings, the credit shall be in an amount not to exceed twenty per cent or $400, whichever is less, of the actual cost of the heat pump; (6) For heat pumps that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1989, but before July 1, 2003, in new and existing multiunit buildings used primarily for residential purposes, the credit shall be in an amount not to exceed twenty per cent or $200 per building unit, whichever is less, of the actual cost of the heat pump; provided that a licensed professional engineer reviews the design of the system and provides a written opinion that the system, in accordance with recognized engineering practice, is designed to provide not less than ninety per cent of the daily annual average hot water needs of all of the occupants of the building; (7) For heat pumps that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1989, but before July 1, 2003, in new and existing hotel, commercial, and industrial facilities, the credit shall be in an amount not to exceed twenty per cent of the actual cost of the heat pump; and (8) For ice storage systems that are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1990, but before July 1, 2003, the credit shall be in an amount not to exceed fifty per cent of the actual cost of the ice storage system. The per unit of actual cost of a solar energy system or heat pump referred to in subsection (b)(3) and (6) shall be determined by multiplying the actual cost of the solar energy system or heat pump installed and placed in service in the multiunit building by a fraction, the numerator being the total square feet of that unit in the multiunit building, and the denominator being the total square feet of all the units in the multiunit building. If federal energy tax credits similar to any of those provided in paragraphs (1) to (8) are established after June 30, 1998, but before July 1, 2003, then the state tax credit provided in the respective paragraph or paragraphs shall be reduced by the amount of the applicable federal energy tax credit. &amp;copy; Tax credits shall apply only to the actual cost of the solar or wind energy system, heat pump, or ice storage system, including their accessories and installation, and shall not include the cost of consumer incentive premiums unrelated to the operation of the system or offered with the sale of the system or heat pump. The tax credit shall be claimed against net income tax liability for the year in which the solar or wind energy system, heat pump, or ice storage system was purchased and placed in use in Hawaii. Tax credits that exceed the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s income tax liability may be used as credit against the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted. (d) The director of taxation shall prepare such forms as may be necessary to claim a credit under this section. The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish reasonable information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91. (e) As used in this section: &amp;ldquo;Solar or wind energy system&amp;rdquo; means any new identifiable facility, equipment, apparatus, or the like that converts solar insolation or wind energy to useful thermal or electrical energy for heating, cooling, or reducing the use of other types of energy dependent upon fossil fuel for their generation. &amp;ldquo;Heat pump&amp;rdquo; means an electric powered compression heating system that extracts energy from warm ambient air or recovers waste heat to assist in the production of hot water. &amp;ldquo;Ice storage system&amp;rdquo; refers to ice banks or other cool energy storage tanks, containers, accessories, and controls that are specifically designed to store ice or chilled fluids for the express purpose of shifting the consumption of energy to off-peak periods.
