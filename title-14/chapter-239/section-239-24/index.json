  "context": "[ยง239-24] Effect of customer&amp;rsquo;s failure to provide its place of primary use; effect of aggregation or segregation of charges. (a) Nothing in this chapter modifies, impairs, supersedes, or authorizes the modification, impairment, or supersession of any law allowing a taxing jurisdiction to collect a tax, charge, or fee from a customer that has failed to provide its place of primary use. (b) If a taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation and if these charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges that are subject to taxation, then the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services may be subject to taxation unless the home service provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to the tax, charge, or fee from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business. &amp;copy; If a taxing jurisdiction does not subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation, a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for mobile telecommunications services unless the customer&amp;rsquo;s home service provider separately states the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider&amp;rsquo;s books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges. (d) A home service provider shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining the customer&amp;rsquo;s place of primary use. Subject to a determination by the department that the customer&amp;rsquo;s place of primary use does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction, and if the home service provider&amp;rsquo;s reliance on information provided by its customer is in good faith, a home service provider may rely on the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the customer and the home service provider shall not be held liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees that are passed on to the customer as a separate itemized charge; provided that a home service provider may treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes under a service contract or agreement in effect on July 28, 2002, as the customer&amp;rsquo;s place of primary use for the remaining term of the contract or agreement, excluding any renewal of the contract or agreement.
