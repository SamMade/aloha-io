Each beneficiary may hold only one account. The director may establish a nonrefundable application fee and an annual fee for each account. An application for an account shall be in the form specified by the director and shall contain: (1) The name, address, and social security number of the account owner; (2) The name, address, and social security number of the designated beneficiary, if the account owner is the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s trustee or guardian; (3) Certification relating to no excess contributions; and (4) Additional information as the director may require. (b) Any person may make contributions to an ABLE savings account after the account is opened, subject to the limitations imposed by section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any rules and regulations adopted by the Secretary and applicable to this chapter. &amp;copy; Contributions to an ABLE savings account may be made only in cash. The director or program manager shall reject or promptly withdraw contributions: (1) If the contribution is in excess of the limits established pursuant to subsection (b); (2) If total contributions cause the value of the account to be equal to or greater than the account maximum established by the director. The account maximum must be equal to the account maximum for postsecondary education savings accounts established pursuant to chapter 256; or (3) If the designated beneficiary is not an eligible individual in the current calendar year. (d) An account owner may: (1) Change the designated beneficiary of an account to an individual who is a member of the family of the prior designated beneficiary in accordance with procedures established by the director; and (2) Transfer all or a portion of an account to another ABLE savings account, the designated beneficiary of which is a member of the family as defined in section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No account owner shall use an interest in an account as security for a loan. Any pledge of an interest in an account shall be of no force and effect. (e) If there is any distribution from an account to any individual or for the benefit of any individual during a calendar year, the distribution shall be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and to the account owner, designated beneficiary, or distributee to the extent required by state or federal law.
