<p>&ldquo;Net weight&rdquo; of a vehicle means the actual weight of the vehicle, as determined on a standard scale, including all equipment and accessories ordinarily attached to and used on the vehicle and, in the case of a motor vehicle, the maximum fuel, oil, and water possible of being carried for its operation; provided that &ldquo;net weight&rdquo; of a new standard equipped vehicle, other than a motor vehicle, means the shipping weight thereof as established by its manufacturer, and &ldquo;net weight&rdquo; of a new standard equipped passenger vehicle means the shipping weight thereof as established by its manufacturer, plus one hundred pounds, and &ldquo;net weight&rdquo; of a new standard equipped motorcycle, motor scooter, or moped, means the shipping weight thereof as established by its manufacturer, plus thirty pounds, and &ldquo;net weight&rdquo; of a new standard equipped truck means the shipping weight thereof as established by its manufacturer, plus two hundred pounds. On initial registration of a standard equipped vehicle, other than a motor vehicle, for which the director of finance has the manufacturer&rsquo;s established weight, the director of finance, in lieu of requiring the vehicle to be weighed and in order to determine the &ldquo;net weight&rdquo; thereof, may use such established weight and may require the owner to furnish verification of the factory serial number of the vehicle. On initial registration of standard equipped passenger vehicles, motorcycles, motor scooters, mopeds, and trucks for which the director of finance has the manufacturer&rsquo;s established weights, the director of finance, in lieu of requiring such motor vehicles to be weighed and in order to determine the &ldquo;net weight&rdquo; thereof, may use such established weights, adding one hundred pounds in the case of standard equipped passenger vehicles, thirty pounds in the case of standard equipped motorcycles, motor scooters, and mopeds, and two hundred pounds in the case of standard equipped trucks, and may require the owners to furnish verification of factory serial and engine numbers of such motor vehicles. As to a vehicle for which the manufacturer&rsquo;s weight is not available or whose make and model cannot be determined with reasonable certainty or which has been so altered as to increase or diminish the weight thereof, &ldquo;net weight&rdquo; means the actual weight of such vehicle, as determined on a standard scale, including all equipment and accessories ordinarily attached to and used on the vehicle and, in the case of a motor vehicle, the maximum fuel, oil, and water possible of being carried for its operation.
