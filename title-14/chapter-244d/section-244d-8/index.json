The amount of the tax for the period covered by the assessment shall not be reduced below the amount determined by an assessment so made, except upon appeal or in a proceeding brought pursuant to section 40-35. &amp;copy; If the taxpayer has paid or returned with respect to any month more than the amount determined to be the correct amount of tax for such month, the amount of the tax so returned and any assessment of tax made pursuant to the return may be reduced, and any overpayment of tax may be credited upon the tax imposed by this chapter, or at the election of the taxpayer, the taxpayer not being delinquent in the payment of any taxes owing to the State, may be refunded in the manner provided in section 231-23&amp;copy;; provided that no reduction of tax may be made when forbidden by subsection (b) or more than five years after the filing of the return.
