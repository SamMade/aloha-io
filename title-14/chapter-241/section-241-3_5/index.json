There shall be allowed as a deduction from entire net income to the extent not deductible in determining federal taxable income, the adjusted eligible net income of an international banking facility, as defined in section 412:5-206, determined as follows: (1) The eligible net income of an international banking facility shall be the amount remaining after subtracting from the eligible gross income the applicable expenses. (2) Eligible gross income shall be the gross income derived by an international banking facility from: (A) Making, arranging for, placing, or servicing loans to foreign persons; provided that in the case of a foreign person which is an individual, or which is a foreign branch of a domestic corporation (other than a bank), or which is a foreign corporation or foreign partnership which is eighty per cent or more owned or controlled, either directly or indirectly, by one or more domestic corporations (other than a bank), domestic partnership, or resident individual, substantially all the proceeds of the loan shall be for use outside of the United States; (B) Making or placing deposits with foreign persons which are banks or foreign branches of banks (including foreign subsidiaries or foreign branches of the taxpayer) or with other international banking facilities; or &amp;copy; Entering into foreign exchange trading or hedging transactions related to any of the transactions described in this paragraph. (3) Applicable expenses shall be any expense or other deduction attributable, directly or indirectly, to the eligible gross income described in paragraph (2). (4) Adjusted eligible net income shall be determined by subtracting from eligible net income the ineligible funding amount, and by subtracting from the amount then remaining the floor amount. (5) The ineligible funding amount shall be the amount, if any, determined by multiplying eligible net income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average aggregate amount for the taxable year of all liabilities, including deposits, and other sources of funds to the international banking facility which were not owed to or received from foreign persons, and the denominator of which is the average aggregate amount from the taxable year of all liabilities, including deposits and other sources of funds of the international banking facility. (6) The floor amount shall be the amount, if any, determined by multiplying the amount remaining after subtracting the ineligible funding amount from the eligible net income by a fraction, not greater than one, which is determined as follows: (A) The numerator shall be: (i) The percentage, as set forth in subparagraph &amp;copy;, of the average aggregate amount of the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s loans to foreign persons and deposits with foreign persons which are banks or foreign branches of banks, or savings and loan associations or foreign branches of savings and loan associations, as the case may be, (including foreign subsidiaries or foreign branches of the taxpayer), which loans and deposits were recorded in the financial accounts of the taxpayer for its branches, agencies, and offices within the State for taxable years 1980, 1981, and 1982, minus; (ii) The average aggregate amount of such loans and such deposits for the taxable year of the taxpayer (other than such loans and deposits to an international banking facility); provided that in no case shall the amount determined in this clause exceed the amount determined in this subparagraph; (B) The denominator shall be the average aggregate amount of the loans to foreign persons and deposits with foreign persons which are banks or foreign branches of banks, including foreign subsidiaries or foreign branches of the bank, (or savings and loan associations, as the case may be) which loans and deposits were recorded in the financial accounts of the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s international banking facility for the taxable year; &amp;copy; The percentage shall be one hundred per cent for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer establishes an international banking facility and for the next succeeding four taxable years. The percentage shall be eighty per cent for the sixth, sixty per cent for the seventh, forty per cent for the eighth, and twenty per cent for the ninth and tenth taxable years next succeeding the year such bank or savings and loan association establishes such facility, and zero in the eleventh succeeding year and thereafter. (7) If adjusted eligible net income is a loss, the amount of such loss shall be added to entire net income. (8) As used in this section, the term &amp;ldquo;foreign person&amp;rdquo; means: (A) An individual who is not a resident of the United States, (B) A foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, or a foreign trust, as defined in section 7701 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, other than a domestic branch thereof, &amp;copy; A foreign branch of a domestic corporation (including the taxpayer), (D) A foreign government or an international organization or an agency of either, or (E) An international banking facility.
