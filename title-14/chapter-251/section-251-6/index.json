On or before the twentieth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year, every person who has become liable for the payment of the surcharge taxes under this chapter during the preceding tax year shall file a return summarizing the person&amp;rsquo;s liability under this chapter for the year, in such form as the director prescribes. The person shall transmit with the return a remittance covering the residue of the surcharge tax chargeable to the person, if any, to the office of the appropriate state district tax assessor designated in section 251-7. The return shall be signed by the person, if made by an individual, or by the president, vice-president, secretary, or treasurer of a corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation. If made on behalf of a partnership, firm, society, unincorporated association, group, hui, joint adventure, joint stock company, corporation, trust estate, decedent&amp;rsquo;s estate, trust, or other entity, any individual delegated by the entity shall sign the same on behalf of the person. If for any reason it is not practicable for the individual person to sign the return, it may be done by any duly authorized agent. The department, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the return on the application of any person and grant such reasonable additional time within which to make the return as the department may deem advisable. Section 232-2 applies to the annual return, but not to a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual return. [L 1991, c 263, pt of ยง1] "
