  "context": "APPEALS FROM ASSESSORS §232-15 Appeal to board of review. The appeal to a board of review may be either to the board of review for the district in which the taxpayer has the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s principal place of business or to the board of review for the district in which the taxpayer resides or has the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s principal office or to the board of review of the first district. The notice of appeal must be lodged with the assessor on or before the date fixed by law for the taking of the appeal. An appeal to the board of review shall be deemed to have been taken in time if the notice thereof shall have been deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the assessor, on or before such date. The notice of appeal must be in writing and any such notice, however informal it may be, identifying the assessment involved in the appeal and stating the grounds of objection to the assessment shall be sufficient. Upon the necessary information being furnished by the taxpayer to the assessor, the assessor shall prepare the notice of appeal upon request of the taxpayer and any notice so prepared by the assessor shall be deemed sufficient as to its form. The appeal shall be considered and treated for all purposes as a general appeal and shall bring up for determination all questions of fact and all questions of law, excepting questions involving the Constitution or laws of the United States, necessary to the determination of the objections raised by the taxpayer in the notice of appeal. Any objection involving the Constitution or laws of the United States may be included by the taxpayer in the notice of appeal and in such case the objections may be heard and determined by the tax appeal court on appeal from a decision of the board of review; but this provision shall not be construed to confer upon the board of review the power to hear or determine such objections. Any notice of appeal may be amended at any time prior to the board&amp;rsquo;s decision; provided the amendment does not substantially change the dispute.
