      <p><strong>ยง468E-4 Persons and practices not affected.</strong> Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing or restricting:</p>

<p>(1) A physician or surgeon from engaging in the practice of medicine in this State; or</p>

<p>(2) A licensed hearing aid dealer from engaging in the practices of fitting and selling hearing aids in this State; or</p>

<p>(3) Any person licensed in this State by any other law from engaging in the profession or occupation for which the person is licensed; or</p>

<p>(4) Any person employed by any federal government agency as a speech pathologist or audiologist from performing that person&rsquo;s duties as an employee of the agency if the person must qualify for employment under government certification or under civil service regulations; provided that this section is applicable only when the person is performing duties as a federal employee. However, such person, without obtaining a license under this chapter, may consult with or disseminate the person&rsquo;s research findings and other scientific information to speech pathologists and audiologists outside the jurisdiction of the organization by which the person is employed. Such person may additionally elect to be subject to this chapter; or</p>

<p>(5) The activities and services of persons pursuing a course of study leading to a degree in speech pathology at a college or university, if such activities and services constitute a part of a supervised course of study and such person is designated &ldquo;speech pathology intern&rdquo;, &ldquo;speech pathology trainee&rdquo;, or by other such titles clearly indicating the training status appropriate to the person&rsquo;s level of training; or</p>

<p>(6) The activities and services of a person pursuing a course of study leading to a degree in audiology at a college or university, if such activities and services constitute a part of a supervised course of study and such person is designated &ldquo;audiology intern&rdquo;, &ldquo;audiology trainee&rdquo;, or by any other such titles clearly indicating the training status appropriate to the person&rsquo;s level of training; or</p>

<p>(7) The activities and services of a person fulfilling the clinical experience requirements or the clinical fellowship year leading to the ASHA certificate of clinical competence; or</p>

<p>(8) The performance of speech pathology or audiology services in this State by any person not a resident of this State who is not licensed under this chapter, if such services are performed for no more than five working days in any calendar year and in cooperation with a speech pathologist or audiologist licensed under this chapter, and if such person meets the qualifications and requirements for application for licensure described in section 468E-5. However, a person not a resident of this State who is not licensed under this chapter, but who is licensed under the law of another state which has established licensure requirements at least equivalent to those established by section 468E-5, or who is the holder of the ASHA certificate of clinical competence in speech pathology or audiology or its equivalent, may offer speech pathology or audiology services in this State for no more than thirty working days in any calendar year, if such services are performed in cooperation with a speech pathologist or audiologist licensed under this chapter.
