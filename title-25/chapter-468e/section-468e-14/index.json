  "context": "§468E-14 Renewal of license. (a) Licenses issued under this chapter expire at midnight, December 31 of each odd-numbered year if not renewed. (b) Every person licensed under this chapter, on or before December 31, 1975, and each odd-numbered year thereafter, shall pay a fee for renewal of the person&amp;rsquo;s license to the board. The board may, in the event payment of the renewal fee is rendered after December 31 of any odd-numbered year, renew a license upon payment of the renewal of license fee plus a monthly late renewal payment penalty, which penalty shall, be multiplied by the number of full months which have elapsed since expiration of the license. No person who requests renewal of license, whose license has expired, shall be required to submit to examination as a condition to renewal, if such renewal application is made within two years from the date of such expiration. &amp;copy; A suspended license is subject to expiration and may be renewed as provided in this section, but such renewal shall not entitle the licensee, while the license remains suspended and until it is reinstated, to engage in the licensed activity, or in any other conduct or activity in violation of the order or judgment by which the license was suspended. (d) A license revoked on disciplinary grounds is subject to expiration as provided in subsection (a) of this section, but it may not be renewed. If such license is reinstated after its expiration, the licensee, as a condition of reinstatement, shall pay a reinstatement fee in an amount equal to the renewal fee in effect on the last preceding regular renewal date before the date on which it is reinstated plus the late renewal payment penalty defined in subsection (b) of this section. (e) Any person who fails to renew the person&amp;rsquo;s license within the five years after the date of its expiration may not renew it, and it may not be restored thereafter, but the person may apply for and obtain a new license if the person meets the requirements of this chapter.
