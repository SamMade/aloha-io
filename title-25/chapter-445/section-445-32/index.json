Any person, firm, private corporation, incorporated or unincorporated trade association, may maintain a suit to enjoin a continuance of any act in violation of sections 445-22 to 445-31 and, if injured thereby, have recovery of damages. If in any such suit the court finds that the defendant is violating or has violated any of the sections, it shall enjoin the defendant from a continuance thereof. It shall not be necessary that actual damages to the plaintiff or petitioner be alleged or proved in order to obtain the injunction. No proceeding shall be instituted for an injunction unless or until plaintiff or petitioner has notified the defendant of the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s or petitioner&amp;rsquo;s intention to file the proceeding unless the defendant ceases and desists from continuing to act in violation of any of the sections, the notice to be given at least twenty-four hours previous to the filing of any action. No injunction shall issue in the event that the defendant ceases violating the sections upon the receipt of the notice, but the giving of the notice or the bringing of a suit or action under this section shall not prevent the institution or continuance to completion of a prosecution under section 445-27, or of a suit under section 445-33. [L 1951, c 196, ยง3; RL 1955, ยง155-29; HRS ยง445-32; gen ch 1985] Rules of Court Injunctions, see HRCP rule 65. Case Notes Injunction issued. 51 H. 502, 463 P.2d 914 (1970). "
