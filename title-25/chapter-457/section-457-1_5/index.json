  "context": "[§457-1.5] Practice of nursing. (a) Nursing is a scientific process founded on a body of professional knowledge. It is a learned profession based on an understanding of the human condition across the lifespan of a client and the relationship of a client with others and within the environment. It is also an art dedicated to caring for others. The practice of nursing means assisting clients in attaining or maintaining optimal health, implementing a strategy of care to accomplish defined goals within the context of a client-centered health care plan, and evaluating responses to nursing care and treatment. Nursing is a dynamic discipline that is continually evolving to include more sophisticated knowledge, technologies, and client care activities. Nursing applies evidence-based practice to promote optimal client outcomes. (b) The scope of nursing practices established in this chapter and by the rules of the board shall serve as general guidelines and are not intended to address the appropriateness of the use of specific procedures in any particular work setting or to grant permission to implement specific procedures in any particular work setting.
