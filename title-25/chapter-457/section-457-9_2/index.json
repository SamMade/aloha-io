(a) Beginning July 1, 2017, with the renewal of the licensing biennium, and every biennial renewal thereafter, each registered nurse and practical nurse licensee shall have completed one of the learning activity options recognized by the board within the two-year period preceding the renewal date, in addition to the requirements of section 457-9. (b) The following nurses shall be exempt from the continuing competency requirements: (1) Registered nurses licensed in this State who also maintain active advanced practice registered nurse licenses in accordance with this chapter and have a current national certification approved by the board; (2) Registered nurses and practical nurses licensed in this State who also maintain current national certification, approved by the board, in their practice role; or (3) A licensee who graduated or completed pre-licensure requirements from an accredited nursing program recognized by the board within twelve months prior to the renewal date of the licensee&amp;rsquo;s first license renewal period. If a licensee graduated or completed pre-licensure requirements from an accredited nursing program more than twelve months but less than two years prior to the renewal date, the registered nurse or practical nurse licensee shall be required to obtain fifteen contact hours of continuing education, one semester credit of post-licensure academic education related to nursing practice from an accredited nursing program, completion of a board-recognized nurse residency program, or other learning activity options from an approved provider recognized by the board prior to the first renewal period. &amp;copy; The board may extend the deadline for compliance with the continuing competency requirements and shall consider each case on an individual basis. Prior to the expiration of the license, a nurse licensee may submit a written request for an extension and any documentation requested by the board to substantiate the reason for the extension of the deadline for compliance with the continuing competency requirements of this section, based on the following circumstances: (1) Illness, as certified by a physician or osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 453 or advanced practice registered nurse licensed under chapter 457 in the jurisdiction in which the licensee was treated; or (2) Military service under extended active duty with the armed forces of the United States. (d) Each licensee shall maintain copies of the licensee&amp;rsquo;s continuing competency records for the past four years or two previous bienniums. (e) Upon application for license renewal, restoration, or reinstatement, each licensee shall have complied with and attest to completion of one of the learning activity options recognized by the board pursuant to subsection (a) during the two years preceding the application for license renewal, restoration, or reinstatement and shall be prepared to submit evidence of completion if requested by the board. (f) The board may conduct an audit to determine compliance with the continuing competency requirement. The board shall provide written notice of an audit to all licensees selected for audit. Within sixty days of notification, the licensee shall provide the board with documentation verifying compliance with continuing competency requirements. [L 2015, c 127, pt of §2] "
