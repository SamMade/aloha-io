(b) Any person licensed as an advanced practice registered nurse prior to October 1, 2009, whose license was granted based on a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in nursing or a current certification for specialized and advanced nursing practice from a national certifying body recognized by the board shall be eligible to renew that license; provided that all nurse licenses and prescriptive authorities or similar designations held by the person in any jurisdiction are unencumbered. &amp;copy; Any person applying for advanced practice registered nurse licensure by endorsement shall be licensed as an advanced practice registered nurse; provided that: (1) The person applying is licensed as a registered nurse in this State; and (2) All nurse licenses and prescriptive authorities or similar designations held by the person under the laws of this State, another state, or a United States territory are unencumbered, and the originating state&amp;rsquo;s requirements were equal to or greater than the board&amp;rsquo;s advanced practice registered nurse requirements which were in effect prior to October 1, 2009.
