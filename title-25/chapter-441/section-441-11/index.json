After property is dedicated to cemetery purposes pursuant to this chapter, neither the dedication nor the title of any plot, crypt, or niche owner shall be affected by the dissolution of the cemetery authority, by nonuser on its part, by alienation of the property, by any liens or encumbrances, by sale under execution, power of sale, or foreclosure, or otherwise except as expressly provided by law. Nothing herein, however, shall affect the rights of encumbrances which attached to property prior to the dedication thereof for cemetery purposes.
