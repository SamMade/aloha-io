No payment, gift, grant, bequest, or other contribution for perpetual care is invalid by reason of any indefiniteness or uncertainty of the persons designated as beneficiaries in the instruments creating the fund, nor is the fund or any contribution to it invalid as violating any law against perpetuities, or the suspension of the power of alienation of title to property. [L 1967, c 199, pt of ยง1; HRS ยง441-35] Cross References Uniform statutory rule against perpetuities, see chapter 525. "
