Renewal registration statements shall be filed with the department on or before July 1 of each calendar year by each professional fundraising counsel or professional solicitor. The renewal statement shall contain the information set forth in subsection (e). A renewal fee of $250, or in any amount and with any additional sums as may be prescribed by the attorney general, shall accompany the renewal statement. If a renewal registration required under this section is not filed, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause, a fine of $20 shall be imposed for each day during which the violation continues; provided that the total amount imposed under this subsection shall not exceed $1,000.</p>

<p>(b) Each professional solicitor, at the time of each filing, shall file with and have approved by the attorney general a bond in which the applicant is the principal obligor in the penal sum of $25,000 issued with good and sufficient surety or sureties approved by the attorney general and which shall remain in effect for one year. The bond shall inure to the benefit of the State, conditioned that the applicant, its officers, directors, employees, agents, servants, and independent contractors shall not violate this chapter. A partnership or corporation that is a professional solicitor may file a consolidated bond on behalf of all its members, officers, and employees.</p>

Within seven business days after receipt of a notification that the registration requirements are not satisfied, the professional fundraising counsel or professional solicitor may request a hearing.</p>

<p>(d) The attorney general may require that registration and renewal registration, surety bonds, and contracts be filed with the department electronically and may require the use of electronic signatures.</p>

<p>(3) A statement whether the registrant has an office in Hawaii and the name and phone number of the person in charge of the office;</p>

<p>(4) The names and addresses of any individuals supervising any solicitation activity;</p>

<p>(5) A statement whether the [registrant] has entered into a consent agreement with, or been disciplined by or subject to administrative action by, another governmental agency;</p>

<p>(6) A statement whether any officer, director, or any person with a controlling interest in the registrant has ever been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving dishonesty in the solicitation for a charitable purpose;</p>

<p>(7) The date that the registrant began soliciting Hawaii residents on behalf of a charitable organization or providing professional fundraising counsel services; and</p>

<p>(8) Whether any owners, directors, or officers are related to:</p>

<p>(B) Any officer, director, trustee, or employee of a charitable organization under contract with the registrant; and</p>
