If the application has been denied, written notice of the decision shall state specifically the reason for denying the application and shall inform the applicant of the right to a hearing under chapter 91. (b) An application shall be considered to be abandoned if an applicant fails to provide evidence of continued efforts to complete the licensing process for two consecutive years; provided that the failure to provide evidence of continued efforts includes but is not limited to: (1) Failure to submit the required documents and other information requested by the licensing authority within two consecutive years from the last date the documents or other information were requested; or (2) Failure to provide the licensing authority with any written communication during two consecutive years indicating that the applicant is attempting to complete the licensing process, including but not limited to attempting to complete the examination requirement; and provided further that the licensing authority may extend the above time periods by rule. The licensing authority shall not be required to act on any abandoned application, and the application may be destroyed by the licensing authority or its delegate. If the application is deemed abandoned by the licensing authority, the applicant shall be required to reapply for licensure and comply with the licensing requirements in effect at the time of reapplication.
