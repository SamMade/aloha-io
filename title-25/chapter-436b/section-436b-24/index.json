Unless otherwise provided by law, in every case in which the licensing authority refuses to issue, renew, restore or reinstate a license, or proposes to take disciplinary action or other licensing sanctions against a licensee, the proceeding before the licensing authority shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 91. In all proceedings before it, the board and each member thereof shall have the same powers respecting administering oaths, compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, and examining witnesses as are possessed by circuit courts.
