      <p><strong>ยง</strong><strong>436B-14.7</strong> <strong>Licensure by endorsement or licensure by reciprocity; initial acceptance by affidavit; temporary license; military spouse.</strong> (a) If a military spouse holds a current license in another state, district, or territory of the United States with licensure requirements that the licensing authority determines are equivalent to or exceed those established by the licensing authority of this State, that military spouse shall receive a license pursuant to applicable statutes or requirements of the licensing authority of this State regarding licensure by endorsement or licensure by reciprocity; provided that the military spouse:</p>

<p>(1) Has not committed an act in any jurisdiction that would have constituted grounds for the limitation, suspension, or revocation of a license; has never been censured or had other disciplinary action taken; has not had an application for licensure denied; or has not refused to practice a profession or vocation for which the military spouse seeks licensure;</p>

<p>(2) Has not been disciplined by a licensing or credentialing entity in another jurisdiction; is not the subject of an unresolved complaint, review procedure, or disciplinary proceeding conducted by a licensing or credentialing entity in another jurisdiction; and has not surrendered membership on any professional staff in any professional association, society, or faculty for another state or licensing jurisdiction while under investigation or to avoid adverse action for acts or conduct similar to acts or conduct which would constitute grounds for disciplinary action in this State;</p>

<p>(3) Pays any fees required by the licensing authority of this State;</p>

<p>(4) Submits with the application a signed affidavit stating that application information, including necessary prior employment history, is true and accurate. Upon receiving the affidavit, if the licensing authority issues the license to the military spouse, the licensing authority may revoke the license at any time if the information provided in the application is found to be false; and</p>

<p>(5) Is the spouse of a military member who is a member in good standing in the active or a reserve component of any of the armed forces of the United States and the military member has orders issued by the appropriate agencies of the armed forces to be stationed in Hawaii for a duration of at least one year.</p>

<p>(b) The licensing authority shall issue to the military spouse a temporary license to allow the military spouse to perform specified services, under the supervision of a professional licensed by this State if appropriate, while completing any requirements necessary for licensure in this State; provided that a temporary license shall only be issued in those professions where credentials, experience, or passage of a national exam is substantially equivalent to or exceed those established by the licensing authority of this State.</p>

<p>&copy; The licensing authority shall expedite consideration of the application and issuance of a license by endorsement, license by reciprocity, or temporary license to a military spouse who meets the requirements of this section.</p>

<p>(d) A license by endorsement or reciprocity issued under subsection (a) shall be valid for the same period of time as a license issued pursuant to the requirements of title 25 for the particular profession; provided that the total time period that a military spouse holds a license issued by endorsement or reciprocity under subsection (a) shall not exceed five years in the aggregate.
