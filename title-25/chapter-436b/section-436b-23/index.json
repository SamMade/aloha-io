  "context": "ยง436B-23 Summary suspension. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the licensing authority or its delegate may cause the immediate suspension or restriction of a license, subject to subsequent notice and hearing or other adequate procedures, upon a specific determination that the failure to take such an action may result in: (1) an immediate and unreasonable threat to personal safety; or (2) fraud or misrepresentation upon consumers, and that, for the protection of the public from the possible consequences of practices, the licensee&amp;rsquo;s license should be immediately suspended or restricted. The licensing authority or its delegate may order the summary suspension of the license for a period not to exceed twenty days. The order of suspension shall be served upon the licensee at the same time as the notice of hearing for disciplinary action, and the hearing shall be scheduled prior to the expiration of the order of suspension. The period of suspension prior to the hearing shall not be extended beyond twenty days except upon request of the licensee for a reasonable continuance to adequately prepare the licensee&amp;rsquo;s defense. Any attempt by the licensee to continue the licensed activity while the license has been summarily suspended shall of itself be sufficient to warrant a permanent revocation of the license and shall subject the licensee to all penalties prescribed by this chapter, the applicable licensing laws, or any rule or order of the licensing authority. [L 1991, c 111, pt of ยง2; am L 1992, c 202, ยง19] "
