(i) The failure of a designated exempt out-of-state collection agency to maintain a current, unrestricted, and unconditional license, permit, or registration in the reciprocal state identified in its application shall cause the automatic forfeiture of the exemption effective as of the date on which the designated exempt out-of-state collection agency&amp;rsquo;s license, permit, or registration is no longer current, unrestricted, or unconditional in the reciprocal state identified in its application. Any collection activity by the designated exempt out-of-state collection agency after the forfeiture date shall be deemed to be unlicensed activity. An out-of-state collection agency whose exemption is forfeited shall apply as a new applicant for an exemption in order to resume business in the State. (j) The remedies or penalties provided by this section are cumulative to the remedies or penalties available under this chapter and all other laws of the State.
