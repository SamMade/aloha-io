(b) All licenses issued by the board shall expire on June 30 of each even-numbered year next following the date of issuance. Failure to renew the license on or before June 30 of each even-numbered year shall automatically constitute a forfeiture of the license; provided that the license shall be restored upon the submission of a written application, a renewal fee, a penalty fee, and proof of completing the applicable continuing education credits to the board. &amp;copy; Prior to the June 30, 2016, payment deadline for license renewal, and prior to every license renewal thereafter, a licensee shall: (1) Pay all required fees; and (2) Complete at least twenty credit hours of continuing education within the two-year period preceding the renewal date. (d) A licensee who has graduated from an accredited veterinary school within one year of the licensee&amp;rsquo;s first license renewal shall not be subject to the continuing education requirement for the first license renewal. (e) Each licensee shall be responsible for maintaining the licensee&amp;rsquo;s continuing education records. At the time of renewal, each licensee shall certify under oath that the licensee has complied with the continuing education requirement of this section. The board may require a licensee to submit, in addition to the certification, evidence satisfactory to the board that demonstrates compliance with the continuing education requirement of this section. (f) The board may conduct random audits of licensees to determine compliance with the continuing education requirement. The board shall provide written notice of an audit to a licensee randomly selected for audit. Within sixty days of notification, the licensee shall provide the board with documentation verifying compliance with the continuing education requirement established by this section. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision, no license shall expire while the licensee is serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United States during any emergency declared by the President or Congress and six months after the termination thereof.
