(a) The commissioner shall establish and maintain a fund that shall be known as the mortgage loan recovery fund from which any person aggrieved by an act, representation, transaction, or conduct of a licensee involving fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit may recover by order of the circuit court or district court of the county where the violation occurred, an amount of not more than $25,000 per transaction, including court costs and fees as set by law and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court, for damages sustained by the fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit of a licensee. (b) In addition to application fees and any fees required by NMLS, a licensee shall pay to the division a mortgage loan recovery fund fee as follows for deposit in the mortgage loan recovery fund: (1) The sum of $300 for each principal office location of a mortgage loan originator company; (2) The sum of $250 for each branch office location of a mortgage loan originator company; and (3) The sum of $200 for each mortgage loan originator. &amp;copy; Upon application for renewal of a license under this chapter, a licensee shall pay, in addition to the licensee&amp;rsquo;s license renewal fee and fees required by NMLS, a mortgage loan recovery fund fee as follows for deposit in the mortgage loan recovery fund: (1) The sum of $200 for each principal office location of a mortgage loan originator company; (2) The sum of $100 for each branch office location of a mortgage loan originator company; and (3) The sum of $100 for each mortgage loan originator.
