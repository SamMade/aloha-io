<p>(d) Requirement for lines of credit shall be as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Applicants for issuance of a dealer&rsquo;s license shall obtain an inventory or flooring line of credit from a federally insured financial institution or from a financing source having a net worth of at least $50,000,000. The line of credit shall be in the following amount:</p>
