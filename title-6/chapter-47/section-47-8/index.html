      <p><strong>ยง47-8 Sale of bonds.</strong> (a) The director of finance may make such arrangements as may be necessary or proper for the sale of each issue of bonds or part thereof as are issued under this chapter, including, without limitation, arranging for the preparation and printing of the bonds, the official statement and any other documents or instruments deemed required for the issuance and sale of bonds and retaining those financial, accounting, and legal consultants, all upon such terms and conditions as the director of finance deems advisable and in the best interest of the county. The governing body may authorize the director of finance to offer the bonds at competitive sale or to negotiate the sale of the bonds to:</p>

<p>(1) Any person or group of persons;</p>

<p>(2) The United States of America, or any board, agency, instrumentality, or corporation thereof;</p>

<p>(3) The employees&rsquo; retirement system of the State;</p>

<p>(4) Any political subdivision of the State;</p>

<p>(5) Any board, agency, instrumentality, public corporation, or other governmental organization of the State; or of any political subdivision of the State.</p>

<p>(b) Subject to any limitation imposed by the governing body by the ordinance or resolution authorizing the bonds, the sale of the bonds by the director of finance by negotiation shall be at such price or prices and upon such terms and conditions, and the bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates or such varying rates determined from time to time in such manner, as the director of finance shall approve.</p>

<p>&copy; Subject to any limitation imposed by the governing body by the ordinance or resolution authorizing the bonds, the sale of the bonds by the director of finance at competitive sale shall be at a price or prices and upon terms and conditions, and the bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates or varying rates determined from time to time in the manner, as specified by the successful bidder, and the bonds shall be sold in accordance with this subsection. The bonds offered at competitive sale shall be sold only after public notice of sale advising prospective purchasers of the proposed sale. The bonds offered at competitive sale may be sold to the bidder offering to purchase the bonds at the lowest interest cost, the interest cost, for the purpose of this subsection, being determined on one of the following bases as selected by the director of finance:</p>

<p>(1) The figure obtained by adding together the amounts of interest payable on the bonds from their date to their respective maturity dates at the rate or rates specified by the bidder and deducting from the sum obtained the amount of any premium offered by the bidder;</p>

<p>(2) Where the interest on the bonds is payable annually, the annual interest rate (compounded annually), or, where the interest on the bonds is payable semiannually, the rate obtained by doubling the semiannual interest rate (compounded semiannually), necessary to discount the principal and interest payments on the bonds from the dates of payment thereof to the date of the bonds and to the price bid (the price bid for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include the amount of interest accrued on the bonds from their date to the date of delivery and payment); or</p>

<p>(3) Where the interest on the bonds is payable other than annually or semiannually or will vary from time to time, upon a basis that, in the opinion of the director of finance, shall result in the lowest cost to the county;</p>

<p>provided that in any case the right shall be reserved to reject any or all bids and waive any irregularity or informality in any bid.</p>

<p>(d) Bonds offered at competitive sale, without further action of the governing body, shall bear interest at the rate or rates specified by the successful bidder or varying rate or rates determined from time to time in the manner specified by the successful bidder with the consent of the director of finance. The notice of sale required by this section shall be given at least once and at least five days prior to the date of the sale in the county and in a financial newspaper or newspapers published in any of the cities of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco, and shall be in a form and contain terms and conditions that the director of finance shall determine. The notice of sale shall comply with the requirements of this section if it merely advises prospective purchasers of the proposed sale and makes reference to a detailed notice of sale which is available to the prospective purchasers and which sets forth the specific details of the bonds and terms and conditions upon which the bonds are to be offered. The notice of sale and any detailed notice of sale may omit the date and time of sale, in which event the date and time shall be either given in the same manner and medium in which the original notice of sale was given, or transmitted via electronic communication systems deemed proper by the director of finance which is generally available to the financial community, in either case at least forty-eight hours prior to the time fixed for the sale.
