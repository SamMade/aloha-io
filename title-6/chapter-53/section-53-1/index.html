Unless otherwise specifically provided, the notice, or the first notice (if more than one), must be made at least three days prior to the date of the hearing or meeting to which it relates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Redevelopment&rdquo; means the planning, development, replanning, redesign, clearance, reconstruction or rehabilitation, or any combination of these, of a redevelopment area or part thereof, and the provision of the residential, commercial, industrial, public, or other structures or spaces as may be appropriate or necessary in the interest of the general welfare, including recreational and other facilities incidental or appurtenant thereto. The term does not exclude the continuance of existing buildings or uses whose demolition and rebuilding or change of use are not deemed essential to the redevelopment and rehabilitation of the area. The term includes provision for open space types of use, such as streets and other public grounds and space around buildings, as well as buildings, structures, and improvements, public or private, and improvements of recreation areas, public or private, and other public grounds.</p>
