      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Acquisition of lands in redevelopment project</h2>
      <p><strong>§53-8 Acquisition of lands in redevelopment project.</strong> After the redevelopment plan is officially approved by the council, or after the thirty-day period has expired or, after the final dismissal or determination of any action, suit or proceeding, if filed (unless the determination holds that the proceedings with reference to the redevelopment plan or the plan are invalid), the redevelopment agency may proceed to acquire land in the redevelopment project.</p>

<p>Private real property in an area, needed for a redevelopment project, which is to be acquired pursuant to this part, may be acquired by the agency by condemnation or otherwise, including any property devoted to a public use, whether or not held in trust, notwithstanding that the property may have been previously acquired by condemnation or is owned by a public utility, it being hereby expressly determined that the public use in conformity with this part shall be deemed a superior public use; provided that real property belonging to a public utility may not be acquired without the approval of the public utilities commission or tribunal having regulatory power over the public utility.</p>

<p>The council may consent to the condemnation of property owned by the county, whether or not the property is held in trust, or may sell or lease to an agency any such property necessary or convenient for a redevelopment project, with or without right to assign or sublease and without public bidding, provided published notice of a meeting to consider the sale or lease is given and a public hearing is held by the council before the action. The term of any such lease shall not be limited by any provision of any other law limiting the period of time during which a lease or any renewal thereof may run.</p>

<p>An award of compensation shall not be increased by reason of any increase in the value of the real property caused by the assembly, clearance, or reconstruction, or proposed assembly, clearance or reconstruction for the purposes of this part of the real property in a redevelopment area.</p>

<p>A council, upon payment therefor or upon exchange for other lands, or without consideration, may convey to an agency land owned by the county in any street or public place which is duly closed or discontinued pursuant to the plan of a redevelopment project.</p>

<p>Public lands or lands owned by any other agency or instrumentality of the government, may, with the approval of the governor, be transferred to an agency by the officer, agency, or instrumentality authorized to convey the same upon payment therefor or upon exchange for other lands, or without consideration, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary.</p>

<p>The procedure upon condemnation by an agency shall be the same as that prescribed by the laws of the State for condemnation by a county except that the members of the agency shall be substituted for the council whenever mentioned in the laws, and that the proceeding shall be brought and title shall be acquired in the name of the agency.</p>

<p>In the event the improvements on any private real property located in any proposed redevelopment area (1) are destroyed by seismic wave, flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm, volcanic activity, explosion, or other catastrophe, natural or of human origin, or (2) are declared by an appropriate state or local authority to be unsafe or unfit for human use or habitation, or (3) the owner or owners thereof are unable or unwilling to improve the property in accordance with the land uses in the proposed redevelopment plan and are willing to sell the property to the agency, the agency may, any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding and in addition to any authority granted to it, acquire the private real property in the proposed redevelopment area by negotiated purchase from the owner or owners and undertake work thereon as provided in section 53-9, upon authorization from the council, by resolution of one reading to purchase the real property, regardless of the stage of development of the redevelopment plan therefor, whether or not the plan has been officially approved by the council or the period of thirty days following the approval has expired. The agency shall not sell, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of the real property, except in connection with first mortgages or other prior liens upon the real property to the federal government for the purpose of securing loans or advances of money made available to the agency, until the redevelopment plan is approved by the council, but if the plan is not approved by the council or is amended to exclude the acquired real property from the redevelopment area or the redevelopment plan is abandoned for any reason, the agency shall dispose of the real property, subject, however, to any first mortgage or other prior lien of the federal government upon the real property, by first offering the same to the former owner or owners for repurchase at the same price paid by the agency for the purchase thereof and if the owner or owners refuse or fail within a reasonable time to exercise the right of repurchase, then the same may be sold at public auction or in the manner provided by law.</p>

<p>Pursuant to section 101-5, the agency may take and acquire any right, interest, or estate less than a fee simple estate, which are necessary for the undertaking and execution of an urban redevelopment or renewal project and related activities under this chapter, including the acquisition of air space rights and the imposition of restrictions, covenants, and controls to assure the development of a continued use of project property in accordance with the redevelopment or renewal plan.
