Any county having a charter may enact an ordinance, and may amend the same from time to time, providing for the making and financing of improvement districts in the county, and such improvements may be made and financed under such ordinance. The county may issue and sell bonds to provide funds for such improvements. Bonds issued to provide funds for such improvements may be either bonds when the only security therefor is the properties benefited or improved or the assessments thereon or bonds payable from taxes or secured by the taxing power of the county. If the bonds are secured only by the properties benefited or improved or the assessments thereon, the bonds shall be issued according and subject to the provisions of the ordinance. If the bonds are payable from taxes or secured by the taxing power, the bonds shall be issued according and subject to chapter 47. Except as is otherwise provided in section 46-80.1, in assessing land for improvements a county shall assess the land within an improvement district according to the special benefits conferred upon the land by the special improvement; these methods include assessment on a frontage basis or according to the area of land within an improvement district, or any other assessment method which assesses the land according to the special benefit conferred, or any combination thereof.
