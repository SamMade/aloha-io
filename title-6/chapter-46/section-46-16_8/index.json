Beginning on January 1, 2018, the director of taxation shall levy, assess, collect, and otherwise administer the county surcharge on state tax. (d) Notice of the public hearing required under subsection (b) or &amp;copy; before adoption of an ordinance establishing or extending the surcharge on state tax shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county at least twice within a period of thirty days immediately preceding the date of the hearing. (e) Each county with a population greater than five hundred thousand that adopts or extends a county surcharge on state tax ordinance pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) shall use the surcharges received from the State for: (1) Capital costs of a locally preferred alternative for a mass transit project; and (2) Expenses in complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 with respect to paragraph (1).

For a county with a population greater than five hundred thousand, capital costs also include non-recurring personal services and other overhead costs that are not intended to continue after completion of construction of the minimum operable segment of the locally preferred alternative for a mass transit project. [L 2005, c 247, §§2, 9; am L 2015, c 240, §3] Revision Note &amp;ldquo;July 12, 2005&amp;rdquo; substituted for &amp;ldquo;the effective date of this Act&amp;rdquo;. Attorney General Opinions Act 247, Session Laws of Hawaii 2005, was not a complete delegation of the State&amp;rsquo;s taxing authority. The legislature retains the power to change, by new legislation, all aspects of the county surcharge, including repealing the county surcharge in its entirety. Att. Gen. Op. 15-1. Subsections (e) and (f) discussed in determining that the provision requiring ten per cent of the county surcharge be withheld as general fund realizations did not create a conflict within the intent of Act 247, Session Laws of Hawaii 2005. Att. Gen. Op. 15-1. "
