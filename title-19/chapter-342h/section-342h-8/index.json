(a) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, if the governor or the director determines that an imminent peril to the public health and safety is or will be caused by the disposal of solid waste or any combination of discharges of other waste that requires immediate action, the governor or the director, without a public hearing, may order any person causing or contributing to the disposal of solid waste or discharge of other waste to immediately reduce or stop the disposal or discharge, and may take any and all other actions as may be necessary. The order shall fix a place and time, not later than twenty-four hours thereafter, for a hearing to be held before the director. (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any power which the governor or any other officer may have to declare an emergency and act on the basis of such declaration, if such power is conferred by statute or constitutional provision, or inheres in the office.
