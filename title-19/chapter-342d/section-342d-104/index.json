(b) Except as provided under section 342D-111, while a commercial passenger vessel is present in the marine waters of the State, the owner or operator of the vessel shall collect routine samples of the vessel&amp;rsquo;s treated sewage and other wastewater that are being discharged into the marine waters of the State with a sampling technique approved by the department before the sample is collected. The number of routine samples for each vessel to be collected under this subsection shall be the greater of two per calendar year or the number of samples required to be collected under federal laws and regulations for sewage or other wastewater discharges. &amp;copy; Except as provided under section 342D-111, while a commercial passenger vessel is present in the marine waters of the State, the department through an independent contractor may collect additional samples of the vessel&amp;rsquo;s treated sewage that are being discharged into the marine waters of the State, or monitor the opacity of air emissions.

Tests required may include tests for fecal coliform, ammonia, residual chlorine, pH (degree of acidity or alkalinity), chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and any other parameters as required by the department. An analytical testing method approved by the department before the testing is conducted shall be used. A laboratory used for testing under this subsection shall agree not to disclose the testing results to any person other than to the department, the United States Coast Guard, or the owner or operator of the vessel. (e) The owner or operator of a commercial passenger vessel shall pay for all routine sampling under subsection (b), additional sampling under subsection &amp;copy;, and for the testing of routine samples. (f) If the owner or operator of a commercial passenger vessel, when complying with another state or federal law that requires substantially equivalent information gathering, has gathered the type of information required under subsection (a), (b), or (d), the owner or operator shall be considered to be in compliance with that subsection so long as the information is also provided to the department. The department shall establish, by rule, requirements for determining substantially equivalent information gathering. [L 2005, c 217, pt of ยง1] "
