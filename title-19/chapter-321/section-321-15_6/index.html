<p>(e) The department shall maintain an inventory of all facilities licensed under this section and shall maintain a current inventory of vacancies therein to facilitate the placement of individuals in such facilities.</p>

<p>(f) The department shall develop and adopt a social model of health care to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of individuals placed in adult residential care homes. The social model of care shall provide for aging in place and be designed to protect the health, safety, civil rights, and rights of choice of the persons to reside in a nursing facility or in home- or community-based care.</p>
