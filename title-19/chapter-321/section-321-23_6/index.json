(a) The department shall adopt rules for emergency medical services that shall include: (1) Uniform methods of rapidly identifying an adult person who has certified, or for whom has been certified, in a written &amp;ldquo;comfort care only&amp;rdquo; document that the person or, consistent with chapter 327E, the person&amp;rsquo;s guardian, agent, or surrogate directs emergency medical services personnel, first responder personnel, and health care providers not to administer chest compressions, rescue breathing, electric shocks, or medication, or all of these, given to restart the heart if the person&amp;rsquo;s breathing or heart stops, and directs that the person is to receive care for comfort only, including oxygen, airway suctioning, splinting of fractures, pain medicine, and other measures required for comfort; (2) The written document containing the certification shall be signed by the patient or, consistent with chapter 327E, the person&amp;rsquo;s guardian, agent, or surrogate and by any two other adult persons who personally know the patient; and (3) The original document containing the certification and all three signatures shall be maintained by the patient, the patient&amp;rsquo;s: (A) Physician; (B) Attorney; &amp;copy; Guardian; (D) Surrogate; or (E) Any other person who may lawfully act on the patient&amp;rsquo;s behalf.
