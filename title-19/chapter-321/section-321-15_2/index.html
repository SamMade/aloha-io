<p>(f) The department may revoke or suspend a current license or certificate, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a license or certificate under rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 if the applicant, operator, employee, or adult volunteer at the healthcare facility or, in the case of any healthcare facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the client:</p>

<p>(h) The department or its designee, in obtaining and relying upon the background check information, is presumed to be acting in good faith and shall be immune from civil liability for taking or recommending action based upon the background check information.

Nothing in this section shall affect rights, obligations, remedies, liabilities, or standards of proof under chapters 368 and 378.</p>

<p>Background check record information shall be used exclusively by the department or its designee for the sole purpose of determining whether an applicant, operator, direct patient access employee, or adult volunteer at a healthcare facility, or, in the case of a facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the clients is suitable for working or living in close proximity to residents of a healthcare facility such that the health, safety, and welfare of the residents would not be at risk.
