These rules, among other things, shall specify how the department or its designee may conduct background checks in accordance with this section.</p>

<p>&copy; All applicants and prospective operators shall:</p>

<p>(1) Be subject to background checks; and</p>

<p>(2) Provide consent to the department or its designee to conduct background checks.</p>

<p>(f) The department may revoke or suspend a current license or certificate, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a license or certificate under rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 if the applicant, operator, employee, or adult volunteer at the healthcare facility or, in the case of any healthcare facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the client:</p>

<p>(h) The department or its designee, in obtaining and relying upon the background check information, is presumed to be acting in good faith and shall be immune from civil liability for taking or recommending action based upon the background check information. The presumption of good faith may be rebutted upon a showing of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the department or its designee relied upon information or opinion that it knew was false or misleading or that such reliance was not reasonable.</p>

<p>(i) Any applicant or operator who receives information from the department or its designee relating to a background check of a direct patient access employee or adult volunteer or, in the case of a healthcare facility operated in a private residence, an adult living in the home other than the clients, is presumed to be acting in good faith and shall be immune from civil liability for reasonably taking or recommending action based upon the department&rsquo;s recommendation or direction. Nothing in this section shall affect rights, obligations, remedies, liabilities, or standards of proof under chapters 368 and 378.</p>

<p>Background check record information shall be used exclusively by the department or its designee for the sole purpose of determining whether an applicant, operator, direct patient access employee, or adult volunteer at a healthcare facility, or, in the case of a facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the clients is suitable for working or living in close proximity to residents of a healthcare facility such that the health, safety, and welfare of the residents would not be at risk.
