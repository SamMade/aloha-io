  "context": "[ยง339D-25] Television recovery system. (a) The department shall use state-specific television sales data or national television sales data available from commercially available analytical sources to determine each television manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recycling responsibilities for covered televisions based upon the television manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s market share. If the department uses national sales data, the department shall extrapolate data for the State from national data on the basis of the State&amp;rsquo;s share of the national population. The department shall seek to establish the most accurate determination of each television manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s market share and may rely on supplemental sources of information to achieve this goal. (b) No later than March 15, 2012, and annually thereafter, the department shall notify each television manufacturer of its recycling obligation. Each television manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s obligation shall be based on that television manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s market share from the previous year multiplied by the total pounds of covered televisions recycled by all television manufacturers during the previous program year. &amp;copy; The department shall develop a consumer education program about the covered television recycling program. (d) Beginning January 1, 2011, the department shall display on its website a toll-free number and current information on covered television recycling locations. [L 2009, c 183, pt of ยง6] "
