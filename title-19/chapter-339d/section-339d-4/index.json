(b) (1) By January 1, 2009, each electronic device manufacturer of new covered electronic devices offered for sale for delivery in this State shall register with the department and pay to the department a registration fee of $5,000. Thereafter, if an electronic device manufacturer has not previously registered, the electronic device manufacturer shall register with the department prior to any offer for sale for delivery in this State of the electronic device manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s new covered electronic devices. (2) Each electronic device manufacturer who is registered shall submit an annual renewal of its registration with the payment of a registration fee of $5,000, by January 1 of each program year.

(d) By March 31, 2011, and annually thereafter, each electronic device manufacturer shall submit to the department the total weight of all covered electronic devices recycled in the previous year, which may include both an electronic device manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s own covered electronic devices and those of other manufacturers. (e) By July 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, the department shall publish a ranking of all electronic device manufacturers selling covered electronic devices in the State, based upon the annual total weight of covered electronic devices recycled by each electronic device manufacturer in the previous year. (f) The State may adopt regulations allowing a procurement preference based upon an electronic device manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s ranking. (g) The department shall review each electronic device manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s plan and, within sixty days of receipt of the plan, shall determine whether the plan complies with this part. If the plan is approved, the department shall notify the electronic device manufacturer or group of electronic device manufacturers. If the plan is rejected, the department shall notify the electronic device manufacturer or group of electronic device manufacturers and provide the reasons for the plan&amp;rsquo;s rejection. Within thirty days after receipt of the department&amp;rsquo;s rejection, the electronic device manufacturer or group of electronic device manufacturers may revise and resubmit the plan to the department for approval.
