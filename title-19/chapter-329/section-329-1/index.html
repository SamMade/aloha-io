<p>Marijuana Prohibition in Hawaii, Steven K. Christensen, 13 HBJ No. 3 Fall 1977, pg. 9.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>In prosecution under §329-43.5(b), trial court should provide jury with an instruction enumerating all fourteen factors listed in statutory definition of drug paraphernalia. 75 H. 80, 856 P.2d 1246.</p>

<p>No error in court failing to dismiss count against defendant for possessing &ldquo;everyday household items not intended or designed for use as drug paraphernalia&rdquo; as broad definition of drug paraphernalia and multiple examples of such contraband enumerated in this section weighed against defendant&rsquo;s contention that the ordinary nature of the containers defendant possessed did not involve the harm or evil sought to be avoided under §329-43.5 or amounted to extenuations that would not have been envisioned by the legislature. 98 H. 196, 46 P.3d 498.</p>
