[L 2000, c 228, pt of §2; am L 2001, c 55, §15; am L 2013, c 178, §3; am L 2015, c 241, §7; am L 2016, c 230, §8] Law Journals and Reviews Gonzales v. Raich: How the Medical Marijuana Debate Invoked Commerce Clause Confusion. 28 UH L. Rev. 261. Case Notes Rule of lenity required the construction, under the specific facts of the case, of §§329-121 and 329-125 and this section against the government, as there was an irreconcilable inconsistency between the authorized transportation of medical marijuana under §329-121, and the prohibition on transport of medical marijuana through &amp;ldquo;any &amp;hellip; place open to the public&amp;rdquo; under subsection [&amp;copy;(2)(E)]; thus, under §701-115(2)(b), petitioner was entitled to an acquittal because petitioner&amp;rsquo;s evidence, when considered in light of any contrary prosecution evidence proved by a preponderance of the evidence the specified fact or facts with negatived penal liability. 129 H. 397, 301 P.3d 607 (2013).
