(a) A qualifying patient or the primary caregiver may assert the medical use of marijuana authorized under this part as an affirmative defense to any prosecution involving marijuana under this part or part IV; or part IV of chapter 712; provided that the qualifying patient or the primary caregiver strictly complied with the requirements of this part. (b) Any qualifying patient or primary caregiver not complying with the permitted scope of the medical use of marijuana shall not be afforded the protections against searches and seizures pertaining to the misapplication of the medical use of marijuana. &amp;copy; No person shall be subject to arrest or prosecution for simply being in the presence or vicinity of the medical use of marijuana as permitted under this part.
