<p>Revision Note</p>

<p>The definition of &ldquo;law enforcement officer&rdquo; in this section reflects the language of the amendment by L 2013, c 232, ยง1, rather than that of the amendment by L 2013, c 221, ยง3.

<p>For description of procedure under chapter, see Thou Shalt Not Commit, Samuel P. King, 5 HBJ 46.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>In light of the definition of &ldquo;dangerous to self&rdquo; under this section, person&rsquo;s refusal to take medications and person&rsquo;s racist remarks to strangers constituted insufficient evidence to support family court&rsquo;s finding that person was imminently and substantially dangerous to person&rsquo;s self. 102 H. 528 (App.), 78 P.3d 341.</p>
