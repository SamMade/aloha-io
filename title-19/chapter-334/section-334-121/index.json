Cross References Intermediate sanctions for selected offenders and defendants, see §§353-10.5, 353-63.5, and 706-605.1. §334-121 Criteria for assisted community treatment. A person may be ordered to obtain assisted community treatment if the family court finds that: (1) The person is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse; and (2) The person is unlikely to live safely in the community without available supervision based on the professional opinion of a psychiatrist; and (3) The person, at some time in the past: (A) has received inpatient hospital treatment for mental illness or substance abuse or (B) has been found to be imminently dangerous to self or others, as a result of mental illness or substance abuse; and (4) The person, based on the person&amp;rsquo;s treatment history and current condition, is now in need of treatment in order to prevent a relapse or deterioration which would predictably result in the person becoming imminently dangerous to self or others; and (5) The person has a history of a lack of adherence to treatment for mental illness or substance abuse, and the person&amp;rsquo;s current mental status or the nature of the person&amp;rsquo;s disorder limits or negates the person&amp;rsquo;s ability to make an informed decision to voluntarily seek or comply with recommended treatment; and (6) The assisted community treatment is medically appropriate, and in the person&amp;rsquo;s medical interests; and (7) Considering less intrusive alternatives, assisted community treatment is essential to prevent the danger posed by the person.
