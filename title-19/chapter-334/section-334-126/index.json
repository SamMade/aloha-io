  "context": "§334-126 Hearing on petition. (a) The court may adjourn or continue a hearing for failure to timely notify a person entitled to be notified. (b) The time and form of the procedure incident to hearing the issues in the petition shall be provided by family court rule and consistent with this part. &amp;copy; Hearings may be held at any convenient place within the circuit. The subject of the petition, any interested party, or the family court upon its own motion may request a hearing in another court because of inconvenience to the parties, witnesses, or the family court or because of the subject&amp;rsquo;s physical or mental condition. (d) The hearing shall be closed to the public, unless the subject of the petition requests otherwise. (e) The subject of the petition shall be present at the hearing. However, if the subject has been served with the petition and does not appear at the hearing, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the subject through the proceedings. (f) Notwithstanding chapter 802 to the contrary, the public defender or other court-appointed counsel shall represent the subject upon filing of the petition. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the public defender by the petitioner. The public defender or the court-appointed counsel may withdraw upon a showing that the subject is not indigent. If the subject does not desire representation, the court may discharge the attorney after finding that the subject understands the proceedings and the relief prayed for in the petition. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to: (1) Require the subject of the petition to accept legal representation by the public defender or other court-appointed counsel; or (2) Prevent the subject of the petition from obtaining their own legal counsel to represent them in any proceeding. (g) If the subject of the petition is represented by an attorney, the attorney shall be allowed adequate time for investigation of the matters at issue and for preparation, and shall be permitted to present the evidence that the attorney believes necessary for a proper disposition of the proceeding. (h) No subject of the petition shall be ordered to receive assisted community treatment unless at least one psychiatrist testifies in person at the hearing who has personally assessed the subject, within a reasonable time before the filing of the petition up to the time when the psychiatrist provides oral testimony at court. The psychiatrist&amp;rsquo;s testimony shall state the facts which support the allegation that the subject meets all the criteria for assisted community treatment, provide a written treatment plan, which shall include non-mental health treatment if appropriate, provide the rationale for the recommended treatment, and identify the designated mental health program responsible for the coordination of care. If the recommended assisted community treatment includes medication, the psychiatrist&amp;rsquo;s testimony shall describe the types or classes of medication which should be authorized, and describe the physical and mental beneficial and detrimental effects of such medication. (i) The subject of the petition may secure a psychiatric examination and present the findings as evidence at the hearing. The subject shall be entitled to a psychiatric examination at a community mental health center if the subject so desires, and if an examination has not already been conducted at a community mental health center which will lead to psychiatric testimony at the hearing.
