<p>(11) Keep records, statistical data, and other information as may be necessary in carrying out the functions of the mental health system and this chapter;</p>

<p>(12) Advocate patients&rsquo; rights in all psychiatric facilities in the State and investigate any grievances submitted to the department by any patient in a psychiatric facility, except as provided in section 334E-2(d).
