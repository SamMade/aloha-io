(a) Pursuant to chapter 91, the director shall establish reasonable charges for treatment services and may make collections on such charges. In making the collections on such charges the director shall take into consideration the financial circumstances of the patient and the patients family including a reciprocal beneficiary, and no collections shall be made where in the judgment of the director, such collections would tend to make the patient or the patients family including a reciprocal beneficiary, a public charge or deprive the patient and the patients family including a reciprocal beneficiary, of necessary support. (b) Every person hospitalized at a psychiatric facility or receiving treatment services through a community mental health center under the jurisdiction of the State or a county, or at a psychiatric facility or through a community mental health center which derives more than fifty per cent of its revenues from the general fund of the State, or pursuant to contract with the director under section 334-2.5, shall be liable for the expenses attending their reception, maintenance, and treatment and any property not exempt from execution belonging to the person shall be subject to sequestration for the payment of the expenses. Every parent or legal guardian of a patient who is a minor and every spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of a patient shall be liable for the expenses attending the reception, maintenance, and treatment of that minor child or spouse or reciprocal beneficiary who is hospitalized at a psychiatric facility or receiving treatment through a community mental health center under the jurisdiction of the State or a county, or at a psychiatric facility or through a community mental health center which derives more than fifty per cent of its revenues from the general fund of the State, or pursuant to contract with the director under section 334-2.5.
