  "context": "ยง327G-14 Optional form. The following sample form may be used to create an advance mental health care directive. This sample form may be duplicated, or modified to suit the needs of the person. Any written document that contains the substance of the following information may be used in an advance mental health care directive: &amp;ldquo;ADVANCE MENTAL HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE Explanation You have the right to give instructions about your own mental health care. You also have the right to name someone else to make mental health treatment decisions for you. This form lets you do either or both of these things. It also lets you express your wishes regarding the designation of your health care providers. If you use this form, you may complete or modify all or any part of it. You are free to use a different form. Part 1 of this form is a list of options you may designate as part of your mental health care and treatment. For ease of designating specific instructions, mark those options in Part 1. Part 2 of this form is a power of attorney for mental health care. This lets you name another individual as your agent to make mental health treatment decisions for you, if you become incapable of making your own decisions, or if you want someone else to make those decisions for you now, even though you are still capable of making your own decisions. You may name alternate agents to act for you if your first choice is not willing, able, or reasonably available to make decisions for you. Unless related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator, or employee of a health care institution where you are receiving care. You may allow your agent to make all mental health treatment decisions for you. However, if you wish to limit the authority of your agent, you may specify those limitations on the form. If you do not limit the authority of your agent, your agent will have the right to: (1) Consent or refuse consent to any care, treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, or otherwise affect a mental condition; (2) Select or discharge health care providers and institutions; (3) Approve or disapprove diagnostic tests, surgical procedures, and programs of medication; and (4) Approve or disapprove of electroconvulsive treatment. Part 3 of this form lets you give specific instructions about any aspect of your mental health care and treatment. Choices are provided for you to express your wishes regarding the provision, withholding, or withdrawal of medication and treatment. Space is provided for you to add to the choices you have made or for you to write out any additional wishes. Part 4 of this form must be completed in order to activate the advance mental health care directive. After completing this form, sign and date the form at the end and have the form witnessed by one or both of the two methods listed below. Give a copy of the signed and completed form to your physician, to any other health care providers you may have, to any health care institution at which you are receiving care, and to any mental health care agents you have named. You should talk to the persons you have named as agents to make sure that they understand your wishes and are willing to take the responsibility. You have the right to revoke this advance mental health care directive or replace this form at any time, unless otherwise specified in writing in the advance mental health care directive. If you are in imminent danger of causing bodily harm to yourself or others, or have been involuntarily committed to a health care institution for mental health treatment, the advance mental health care directive will not apply.
