Each operator of a municipal solid waste landfill or incineration facility shall keep records of all deliveries of solid waste to the facility, including, but not limited to, the source of the waste, the kind of waste received, and the weight or volume, or both, of the waste. The records shall be made available to the department and the respective county for inspection, upon request. At the request of a county, the department may exempt a specific facility from this requirement, or may modify this requirement for a specific facility, if the department determines that the cost of compliance is likely to exceed the value of accurate and thorough data. If the department grants an exemption to a facility under this section, the public shall be notified through a statewide public notice. [L 1991, c 324, pt of ยง2; am L 1998, c 2, ยง90] "
