      <p><strong>[PART VIII.] DEPOSIT BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM</strong></p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>L 2004, c 241, §13 provides:</p>

<p>&ldquo;SECTION 13. Unless modified hereafter pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the following definition shall supersede the current definition of &ldquo;recycling drop-off facility&rdquo; as it appears in title 11, chapter 58.1, Hawaii Administrative Rules:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Recycling drop-off facility&rdquo; means a structure or site designated for collection and small scale (low technology) segregation of recyclable materials. The staffed or unstaffed site will receive and temporarily store &ldquo;dropped-off&rdquo; recyclable materials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sixty-eight-fluid-ounce deposit beverage containers. L 2007, c 285, §§11 and 12 provide:</p>

<p>&ldquo;SECTION 11. The department of health shall phase-in all requirements affecting the redemption of sixty-eight-fluid-ounce containers, beginning December 1, 2007, as follows; provided that the phase-in shall be completed by March 1, 2008:</p>

<p>(1) From December 1, 2007, distributors of deposit beverage containers may begin marking sixty-eight-fluid-ounce deposit beverage containers as required under section [342G-112(a)], Hawaii Revised Statutes;</p>

<p>(2) From December 1, 2007, until March 1, 2008, a sixty-eight-fluid-ounce deposit beverage container may be redeemed under the deposit beverage container program, without regard to whether the container bears the refund value of the container and the word &ldquo;Hawaii&rdquo; or the letters &ldquo;HI&rdquo;, required by section 342G-112(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes;</p>

<p>(3) Beginning March 1, 2008, every deposit beverage container holding up to sixty-eight fluid ounces and sold in the State shall be marked as required under section 342G-112(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes; and</p>

<p>(4) Beginning March 1, 2008, only deposit beverage containers meeting the requirements of section 342G-112(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall be eligible for redemption.</p>

<p>SECTION 12. (a) The legislature finds that the public interest in protecting the environment takes precedence over the delay in implementation of redemption of sixty-eight-fluid-ounce beverage containers under this Act. The legislature finds that the redemption rate is below the balance of the deposit beverage container deposit special fund.</p>

<p>(b) The department of health shall reimburse a redemption center, from the deposit beverage container deposit special fund, the refund values paid to a redeemer, as defined in section 342G-101, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for sixty-eight-fluid-ounce containers redeemed between December 1, 2007, and March 1, 2008, pursuant to section 11 of this Act; provided that a redemption center shall provide collection reports under section 342G-119, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for the sixty-eight-fluid-ounce beverage containers.&rdquo;</p>
