(a) Prior to submitting to the office a plan that has been formally adopted by a county, the county and the office may negotiate plan components the county finds infeasible. The public shall be notified of all plan components that are determined to be infeasible. (b) The office shall review the county-adopted plan and approve, conditionally approve, approve specific elements or components, or disapprove the plan. The office shall have sixty days to render a decision, unless the office gives written notice to the county that additional time is necessary to complete the review. &amp;copy; The office shall approve any county plan or revised plan that demonstrates to its satisfaction that: (1) The plan is reasonably complete and accurate, and consistent with this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter; (2) The plan provides for the maximum feasible development and implementation of source reduction, recycling, and bioconversion programs, and demonstrates a feasible schedule, funding source, and amount for doing so; (3) The plan provides for the disposal of solid waste that is not reduced, recycled, or altered through bioconversion, in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of this chapter; and (4) The plan accomplishes all of the above in a manner consistent with chapter 226. (d) To expedite and facilitate the plan development, review, and adoption process, the office, at the request of a county, may participate directly in the county adoption process by attending public hearings and county council sessions. (e) The department shall notify the public of the approval, conditional approval, approval of specific elements or components, or disapproval of the plan. The director may hold a public hearing on the plan if the director determines that a public hearing is in the public interest. [L 1991, c 324, pt of ยง2] "
