Whenever the department of health finds after investigation that the distribution in the State of any class of food may, by reason of contamination with microorganisms during manufacture, processing, or packing thereof in any locality, be injurious to health, and that the injurious nature cannot be adequately determined after such articles have entered commerce, it then, and in such case only, shall prescribe regulations providing for the issuance, to manufacturers, processors, or packers of such class of food in the locality, of permits to which shall be attached such conditions governing the manufacture, processing, or packing of such class of food, for such temporary period of time, as may be necessary to protect the public health. After the effective date of the regulations, and during the temporary period, no person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce any such food manufactured, processed, or packed by any such manufacturer, processor, or packer unless the manufacturer, processor, or packer holds a permit issued by the department as provided by such regulations.
