      <p><strong>ยง328-9 Foods deemed adulterated when.</strong> A food shall be deemed to be adulterated:</p>

<p>(1) (A) If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but if the substance is not an added substance, the food shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of the substance in the food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health; or</p>

<p>(B) (i) If it bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance, other than one which is a pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity; a food additive; or a color additive, which is unsafe within the meaning of section 328-13(a); or</p>

<p>(ii) If it is a raw agricultural commodity and it bears or contains a pesticide chemical which is unsafe within the meaning of section 408(a) of the Federal Act as amended; or</p>

<p>(iii) If it is or it bears or contains any food additive which is unsafe within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Act as amended;</p>

<p>provided that where a pesticide chemical has been used in or on a raw agricultural commodity in conformity with an exemption granted or tolerance prescribed under section 408 of the Federal Act, and the raw agricultural commodity has been subjected to processing such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydrating, or milling, the residue of such pesticide chemical remaining in or on such processed food, notwithstanding section 328-13 and clause (iii) of this paragraph (1), shall not be deemed unsafe if the residue in or on the raw agricultural commodity has been removed to the extent possible in good manufacturing practice, and the concentration of such residue in the processed food when ready-to-eat, is not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity; or</p>

<p>&copy; If it consists in whole or in part of a diseased, contaminated, filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise unfit for food; or</p>

<p>(D) If it has been produced, prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered diseased, unwholesome, or injurious to health; or</p>

<p>(E) If it is the product of a diseased animal or an animal which has died otherwise than by slaughter, or that has been fed upon the uncooked offal from a slaughterhouse; or</p>

<p>(F) If its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health;</p>

<p>(2) (A) If any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom; or</p>

<p>(B) If any substance has been substituted wholly or in part therefor; or</p>

<p>&copy; If damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or</p>

<p>(D) If any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength or make it appear better or of greater value than it is;</p>

<p>(3) If it is confectionery and:</p>

<p>(A) Has partially or completely embedded therein any nonnutritive object; provided that this clause shall not apply in the case of any nonnutritive object if, in the judgment of the director of health, as provided by rules, promulgated under this part, the object is of practical functional value to the confectionery product and would not render the product injurious or hazardous to health;</p>

<p>(B) Bears or contains any alcohol in excess of five per cent by weight; or</p>

<p>&copy; Bears or contains any nonnutritive substance; provided that this clause shall not apply to a safe nonnutritive substance which is in or on confectionery by reason of its use for some practical functional purpose in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of the confectionery if the use of the substance does not promote deception of the consumer or otherwise result in adulteration or misbranding in violation of this part; and provided further that the director, for the purpose of avoiding or resolving uncertainty as to the application of this clause, may issue rules under this part, allowing or prohibiting the use of particular nonnutritive substances;</p>

<p>(4) If it is or bears or contains any color additive which is unsafe within the meaning of the Federal Act.
