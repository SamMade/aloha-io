(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), in the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor, a person other than the donor is barred from making, amending, or revoking an anatomical gift of a donor&amp;rsquo;s body or body part if the donor made an anatomical gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or body part under section 327-5, or an amendment to an anatomical gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or the body part under section 327-6. (b) A donor&amp;rsquo;s revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or a body part under section 327-6 is not a refusal and shall not bar another person specified in section 327-4 or 327-9 from making an anatomical gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or a body part under section 327-5 or 327-10. &amp;copy; If a person other than the donor makes an unrevoked anatomical gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or a body part under section 327-5, or an amendment to an anatomical gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or a body part under section 327-6, another person may not make, amend, or revoke the gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or body part under section 327-10.

(e) In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under section 327-4, an anatomical gift of a body part is neither a refusal to give another body part nor a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of another body part at a later time by the donor or another person. (f) In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under section 327-4, an anatomical gift of a body part for one or more of the purposes set forth in section 327-4 is not a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of the body part for any of the other purposes by the donor or any other person under section 327-5 or 327-10. (g) If a donor who is an unemancipated minor dies under eighteen years of age, a parent of the donor who is reasonably available may revoke or amend an anatomical gift of the donor&amp;rsquo;s body or body part. (h) If an unemancipated minor who signed a refusal dies under eighteen years of age, a parent of the individual who is reasonably available may revoke the individual&amp;rsquo;s refusal.
