(d) If an anatomical gift of one or more specific body parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in subsection (a) and does not identify the purpose of the gift, the decedent&amp;rsquo;s body parts may be used only for transplantation or therapy, and the gift shall pass in accordance with subsection (f).
