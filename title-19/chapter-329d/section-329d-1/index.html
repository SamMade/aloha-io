<p>&ldquo;Subcontractor&rdquo; or &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; means any person or entity with whom the dispensary licensee has a contract to perform any of its production center or retail dispensing location operations; provided that it does not include a person or entity retained by a dispensary licensee to perform services ancillary to the operations of a dispensary, including but not limited to construction, installation, or maintenance of the dispensary&rsquo;s facility, security systems, or tracking system, and laboratory testing.
