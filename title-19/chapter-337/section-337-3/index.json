Whenever the executive authority of any state demands of the executive authority of the State any fugitive within the purview of section 337-2 and produces a copy of the commitment, decree, or other judicial process and proceedings, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state whence the person so charged has fled, with an affidavit made before a proper officer showing the person to be such a fugitive, it shall be the duty of the executive authority of the State to cause the fugitive to be apprehended and secured, if found in the State and to cause immediate notice of the apprehension to be given to the executive authority making the demand, or to the agent of the authority appointed to receive the fugitive, and to cause the fugitive to be delivered to the agent when the agent shall appear. If no such agent appears within thirty days from the time of the apprehension, the fugitive may be discharged. All costs and expenses incurred in the apprehending, securing, maintaining, and transmitting the fugitive to the state making the demand shall be paid by such state. Any agent so appointed who receives the fugitive into the agent&amp;rsquo;s custody shall be empowered to transmit the fugitive to the state from which the fugitive has fled. The executive authority of the State is vested with the power, on the application of any person interested, to demand the return to the State of any fugitive within the purview of this chapter.
