Information and techniques developed under this program shall be made available to all generators in the State. (b) The assistance program shall include at least the following elements: (1) Outreach programs, including on-site consultation at locations where hazardous waste is generated, seminars, workshops, training programs, and other similar activities designed to assist generators in evaluating their hazardous waste generation and management practices, identifying opportunities for waste reduction and improved management, and identifying subjects that require additional information and research; (2) A program to assemble, catalog, and disseminate information about hazardous waste reduction and management methods, available commercial waste management facilities and consultant services, and regulatory programs; (3) Evaluation and interpretation of information needed by generators to improve their management of hazardous waste; and (4) Informational and technical research to identify alternative technical solutions that can be applied by specific generators to reduce the generation of hazardous waste. &amp;copy; The program shall be coordinated with other public and private programs that provide management and technical assistance to smaller businesses and small quantity generators, including any program operated by a public or private educational institution.
