(a) The director may establish, by rule, standards applicable to persons who generate, transport, treat, store, dispose, process, re-refine, burn (including burning for purposes of energy recovery), recycle, distribute, market, or otherwise handle used oil or used oil fuel, regardless of whether the used oil or used oil fuel is a hazardous waste. (b) No new oil, used oil, or recycled oil shall be discharged or caused or allowed to enter into the sewers, drainage systems, surface or ground waters, watercourse, marine waters, or onto the ground. The prohibition shall not apply to inadvertent, normal discharges from vehicles and equipment, or maintenance and repair activities associated with vehicles; provided that appropriate measures are taken to minimize releases. Appropriate measures include, but are not limited to, use of drip pans, institution of structural catchment systems, use of absorbent materials, and other similar measures.
