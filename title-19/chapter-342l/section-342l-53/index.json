Nothing in this subsection shall bar any agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to such an agreement for any liability under this section. Nothing in this chapter shall bar a cause of action that an owner or operator or any other person subject to liability under this section, or a provider of financial assurance, has or would have, by reason of subrogation or otherwise against any person.
