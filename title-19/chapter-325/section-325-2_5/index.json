(f) Health care-associated infection information held by the department as a result of reporting under this section is not subject to subpoena, discovery, or introduction into evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding; provided that health care-associated infection information otherwise available from other sources is not immune from subpoena, discovery, or introduction into evidence through those sources solely because the information was reported as required by this section. (g) Beginning on June 30, 2013, and no later than June 30 of each year, thereafter, the department shall prepare a public report, in accordance with this section, containing information pertaining to health care-associated infections in the State for the previous calendar year.
