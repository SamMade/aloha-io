  "context": "[§340E-4.7] Notification to users of potential lead contamination. Before June 19, 1988, every public water system shall identify and provide notice to persons that may be affected by lead contamination of their drinking water where such contamination results from either the lead content in the construction materials of the public water distribution system or corrosivity of the water supply sufficient to cause leaching of lead, or both. The notice shall provide a clear and readily understandable explanation of the following: (1) The potential sources of lead in the drinking water; (2) The potential adverse health effects; (3) The reasonably available methods of mitigating known or potential lead content in drinking water; (4) Any steps the system is taking to mitigate lead content in drinking water; and (5) The necessity for seeking alternative water supplies, if any. The failure to comply with the notification required in this section shall subject the supplier of water to the same penalties under section 340E-6. [L 1987, c 165, pt of §1] "
