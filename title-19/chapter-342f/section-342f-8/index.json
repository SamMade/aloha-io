(a) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, if the director determines that an imminent peril to the public health and safety is or will be caused by excessive noise, which requires immediate action, the director, with the approval of the governor and without public hearing, may order any person causing or contributing to the excessive noise to immediately reduce or stop such emission, or the director may take any and all other actions as may be necessary. Such order shall fix a place and time, not later than twenty-four hours thereafter, for a hearing to be held before the director. (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any power which the governor or any other officer may have to declare an emergency and act on the basis of such declaration, if such power is conferred by statute or constitutional provision, or inheres in the office.
