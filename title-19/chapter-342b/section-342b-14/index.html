      <p><strong>[ยง342B-14] Variances.</strong> (a) Every application for a variance shall be made on forms furnished by the department and shall be accompanied by a complete and detailed description of present conditions, how present conditions do not conform to applicable standards, and such other information as the department may by rule prescribe.</p>

<p>(b) Each application for a variance shall be reviewed in light of the descriptions, statements, plans, histories, and other supporting information submitted with the application, such additional information as may be submitted upon the request of the department, and the effect or probable effect upon the air quality standards established pursuant to this chapter.</p>

<p>&copy; Whenever an application for a variance is approved, the department shall issue a variance authorizing the emission or discharge of an air pollutant in excess of applicable standards. No variance shall be granted by the department unless the application and the supporting information clearly show that:</p>

<p>(1) The continuation of the function or operation involved in the discharge of air pollution occurring or proposed to occur by the granting of the variance is in the public interest as determined in section 342B-27;</p>

<p>(2) The emission or discharge occurring or proposed to occur does not substantially endanger human health or safety; and</p>

<p>(3) Compliance with the applicable standards or rules from which a variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public.</p>

<p>(d) Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the requirements of this section and for time periods and under conditions consistent with the reasons therefor, and within the following limitations:</p>

<p>(1) If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, control, or abatement of the air pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary means for prevention, control, or abatement becomes practicable and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the department may prescribe. No renewal of a variance granted under this subsection shall be allowed without a thorough review of known and available means of preventing, controlling, or abating the air pollution involved;</p>

<p>(2) The director may issue a variance for a period not exceeding five years; and</p>

<p>(3) Every variance granted under this section shall include conditions requiring the grantee to perform air or discharge sampling and report the results of such sampling to the department.</p>

<p>(e) Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed from time to time on terms and conditions and for periods not exceeding five years which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance; provided that the applicant for renewal has met all of the conditions specified in the immediately preceding variance; and provided further that the renewal, and the variance issued in pursuance thereof, shall provide for emission or discharge not greater than that attained pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding variance at its expiration. No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least one hundred eighty days prior to the expiration of the variance. The director shall act on an application for renewal within one hundred eighty days of the receipt of such application.</p>

<p>(f) The director may afford a hearing in accordance with chapter 91 in relation to an application for the issuance, renewal, or modification of a variance.</p>

<p>(g) No variance shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of any emergency provisions and procedures provided by law.</p>

<p>(h) Any application for a variance shall be subject to the public participation requirements of section 342B-13. The contents of the public notice on the variance application for a variance shall include at least:</p>

<p>(1) The name and address of the applicant;</p>

<p>(2) A brief description of the applicant&rsquo;s activities or operations which result in the emission, or other activity described in the variance application;</p>

<p>(3) A short description of the location of each emission or discharge indicating whether such emission or discharge is new or existing;</p>

<p>(4) A brief description of the public participation procedures, including the comment period and other means by which interested persons may comment on the variance application and the department&rsquo;s proposed action; and</p>

<p>(5) The address and phone number of the state agency at which interested persons may obtain further information and may inspect a copy of the variance application and supporting and related documents. [L 1992, c 240, pt of ยง1]</p>
