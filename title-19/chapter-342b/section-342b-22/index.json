The director may exempt any nonmajor category of covered sources from the permit obligation for a period of five years after the effective date of the rules establishing the permit program. (b) Within twelve months after the effective date of the rules establishing the permit program, the owner or operator of a covered source shall submit to the department an application for a permit and a compliance plan. &amp;copy; No person shall begin construction, modification, or relocation of any covered source without first obtaining a permit from the director. (d) The director may require any person who owns, operates, or desires to construct, modify, or relocate a source other than a covered source to obtain a permit prior to the construction, modification, relocation, operation, or continued operation. (e) Permits being renewed shall be subject to the same procedural requirements that apply to initial permit issuance, including the procedure of federal oversight and public participation. (f) Permit expiration terminates the source&amp;rsquo;s right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal application is submitted to the department and provided the owner or operator acts consistently with the permit previously granted, the application on which it was granted, and all plans, specifications, and other information submitted as a part thereof.
