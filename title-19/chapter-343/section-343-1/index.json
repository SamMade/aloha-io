  "context": "ยง343-1 Findings and purpose. The legislature finds that the quality of humanity&amp;rsquo;s environment is critical to humanity&amp;rsquo;s well being, that humanity&amp;rsquo;s activities have broad and profound effects upon the interrelations of all components of the environment, and that an environmental review process will integrate the review of environmental concerns with existing planning processes of the State and counties and alert decision makers to significant environmental effects which may result from the implementation of certain actions. The legislature further finds that the process of reviewing environmental effects is desirable because environmental consciousness is enhanced, cooperation and coordination are encouraged, and public participation during the review process benefits all parties involved and society as a whole. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a system of environmental review which will ensure that environmental concerns are given appropriate consideration in decision making along with economic and technical considerations. [L 1979, c 197, ยง1(1); am L 1983, c 140, ยง4] "
