If two or more applications which otherwise comply with section 174C-49 are pending for a quantity of water that is inadequate for both or all, or which for any other reason are in conflict, the commission shall first, seek to allocate water in such a manner as to accommodate both applications if possible; second, if mutual sharing is not possible, then the commission shall approve that application which best serves the public interest. [L 1987, c 45, pt of ยง2] Case Notes Petitions for interim instream flow standard amendments are not among the water use permit applications &amp;ldquo;competing&amp;rdquo; under this section; the statute relating to instream use protection, ยง174C-71, operates independently of the procedures for water use regulation outlined in this part. 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.
