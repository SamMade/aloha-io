      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">License; application; fees; restrictions</h2>
      <p><strong>§188-50 License; application; fees; restrictions.</strong> (a) It is unlawful for any person, except children below nine years of age, to fish, take, or catch any introduced freshwater game fish without first obtaining a license. Children exempt by this section may fish, provided they are accompanied by a licensed person. The department of land and natural resources may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary for the purposes of this chapter and to set fees for freshwater game fish fishing.</p>

<p>(b) The licenses may be issued by agents of the department of land and natural resources upon written application in such form as may be prescribed by the department together with payment of a fee. The fees for licenses and duplicate licenses shall be established by the department by rules adopted in accordance with chapter 91.</p>

<p>&copy; No person to whom a license has been issued under this section shall permit any other person to carry, display, or use the license for any purpose. Every person to whom a license has been issued under this section shall show the license upon demand of any officer authorized to enforce the fishing laws of the State. No person shall refuse any officer the examination or inspection of any bag or container of any kind used to carry fish or any vehicle or conveyance used to transport fish.</p>

<p>The department, upon written application, may issue a permit to a club or group of minors, not less than five in number, for unlicensed fishing where such activity will be supervised by responsible adults. All adults accompanying the excursions, however, shall themselves be licensed. The application shall state the area to be visited, the dates for the excursion, the name of the organization or group, and shall be signed by an adult advisor of the group. The permits shall expire and become void thirty days after issuance. The department may determine other terms and conditions of the permits.</p>

<p>(d) Where a bag limit is specified for the catching of freshwater fish, each licensee may take only one bag per day. This restriction to one bag applies to each minor participating in unlicensed group excursions for which permits have been issued under this section. The catch of a child below the age of nine years shall be deemed part of the catch of the licensed adult accompanying the child.</p>

<p>(e) The department may revoke any license for any infraction of the terms and conditions of the license. Any person whose license has been revoked shall not be eligible to apply for another license until expiration of one year from the date of revocation.</p>

<p>(f) The department shall suspend, refuse to renew, reinstate, or restore, or deny any license or application if the department has received certification from the child support enforcement agency pursuant to section 576D-13 that the licensee or applicant is not in compliance with an order of support as defined in section 576D-1 or has failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to a paternity or child support proceeding. The department shall issue, renew, restore, or reinstate a license only upon receipt of an authorization from the child support enforcement agency, the office of child support hearings, or the family court.
