(a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board may enter into a capital advancement contract with a private party for any public improvement to or construction of a state small boat harbor, if the chairperson determines that a capital advancement contract promotes the best interest of the State by finding that: (1) Private development is likely to be less costly than any other type of contract; (2) Private development provides needed public improvements on a significantly more timely basis; or (3) Public financing for the public improvements is not available on a timely basis. (b) A capital advancement contract under subsection (a) may be financed by legislative appropriation to reimburse the private party or by credit against the private party&amp;rsquo;s future rental or tariff payments to the State; provided that the terms of the contract shall ensure that the State benefits financially from the arrangement and that public use of the facility is maintained; provided further that capital advancement contracts under this section shall not be general obligations of the State for which the full faith and credit of the department is pledged and the legislature shall have no obligation to appropriate funds to reimburse a private party to a capital advancement contract. &amp;copy; A capital advancement contract under subsection (a) shall be subject to the requirements of chapters 103 and 103D and be subject to the approval of the board; provided that all related transactions shall be subject to state audit.
