  "context": "[ยง200-4.6] Alternate access to state boating facilities; rules. The department shall adopt rules to allow vessels holding a valid ocean recreation management area commercial use permit to use a state small boat harbor or boat launching ramp when unsafe wind and sea conditions would prevent safe access to the shoreline through a designated ingress or egress zone. The vessel operator or master shall give the department prior notice of the presence or threat of such conditions and shall be subject to local direction and control as necessary to avoid conflict with other users of the facility. Use of a state boating facility in accordance with this section shall not affect the permittee&amp;rsquo;s right to use such boating facilities in the absence of such conditions in order to provision a vessel as permitted by law. [L 2012, c 195, pt of ยง2] "
