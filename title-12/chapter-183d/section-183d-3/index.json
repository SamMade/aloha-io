  "context": "ยง183D-3 Rules. Subject to chapter 91, the department shall adopt, amend, and repeal rules: (1) Concerning the preservation, protection, regulation, extension, and utilization of, and conditions for entry into wildlife sanctuaries, game management areas, and public hunting areas designated by the department; (2) Protecting, conserving, monitoring, propagating, and harvesting wildlife; (3) Concerning size limits, bag limits, open and closed seasons, and specifications of hunting gear which may be used or possessed; and (4) Setting fees for activities permitted under this chapter, unless otherwise provided for by law. The rules may vary from county to county or in any part of the county and may specify certain days of the week or certain hours of the day in designating open seasons, except that any fees established by rule shall be the same for each county. All rules shall have the force and effect of law. [L 1985, c 174, pt of ยง4; am L 1988, c 12, ยง1] Case Notes Sections 183D-22 and 183D-10.5 provided the authority for the department of land and natural resources to require payment of a fee for a hunting-related article such as a stamp; however, since game bird hunting was an activity permitted under this chapter, the department was required under this section to adopt a rule pursuant to ยง91-3 when setting the stamp fees for hunting. 117 H. 16 (App.), 175 P.3d 126. Since the addition of two extra hunting days to each week of the hunting season concerned &amp;ldquo;conditions for entry into game management areas, and public hunting areas designated by the department of land and natural resources&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;open seasons&amp;rdquo; for hunting, the express language of this section mandated that in order to add the two weekdays for bird hunting, the department had to amend Hawaii administrative rule 13-122-4 pursuant to chapter 91. 117 H. 16 (App.), 175 P.3d 126.
