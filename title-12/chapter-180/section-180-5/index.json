Within thirty days after the filing of such a petition, the department of land and natural resources shall cause due notice to be given of a public meeting to consider the question of the need for the creation of the district, whether local public sentiment is in favor of its creation and the area that should be included within its boundaries. After such meeting, if the department determines that there is a need for the district and public sentiment favors its creation, it shall define the boundaries for the proposed district. Should the department deny any petition to organize a district, subsequent petitions covering the same or substantially the same area may be filed with the department after six months after the date of the denial of the petition.
