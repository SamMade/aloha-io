  "context": "§174-1 Findings and declaration of necessity. It is hereby found that it is important to the welfare of the people of Hawaii that the overall economy of the State including but not limited to agricultural production, be developed as fully as possible. It is further found that water presently tapped for consumption is inadequate for the fullest development of the economy of the State. It is therefore hereby declared that additional land and water facilities are necessary for the development of the overall economy of the State. It is the intent of the legislature that no project under this chapter shall be organized in the city and county of Honolulu or other counties without the board of land and natural resources first consulting the board of water supply of the city and county of Honolulu or the water board or department of each county.
