Special livestock use (A) First class&amp;ndash;Lands highly suitable for special livestock uses such as swine, dairy, and poultry production. In making the determination, consideration shall be given to drainage, climate, topography, proximity to market, and transportation and compatibility to adjoining land use, among other considerations. &amp;ldquo;Dairy&amp;rdquo; as used for disposition purposes means a &amp;ldquo;dry lot&amp;rdquo; dairy without allowance for grazing. (B) Second class&amp;ndash;Lands suitable for special livestock uses, but inferior to those of first class. 3.

(B) Second class&amp;ndash;Lands having a potentially medium economic animal unit carrying capacity and capable of moderate liveweight gains per acre per year, such as, five to twenty acres per animal unit per year and twenty to one hundred pounds live beef gains per animal unit per acre per year. &amp;copy; Third class&amp;ndash;Lands having a relatively low animal unit carrying capacity and producing correspondingly low liveweight gains per acre per year, such as, more than twenty acres per animal unit per year and less than twenty pounds average live beef gains per animal unit per acre per year. 4. Commercial timber use (A) First class&amp;ndash;Lands of high suitability for growth of merchantable timber having mean annual growth potential under normal forest management practices with yields exceeding amounts such as one thousand board feet per acre, and with location and terrain presenting favorable logging, transportation, and marketing conditions. (B) Second class&amp;ndash;Lands of high suitability for growth of merchantable timber having mean annual growth potential under normal forest management practices with yields exceeding amounts such as one thousand board feet per acre, and with location and terrain presenting less favorable logging, transportation, and marketing conditions. &amp;copy; Third class&amp;ndash;Lands of medium suitability for growth of merchantable timber having mean annual growth potential in amounts such as five hundred to one thousand board feet per acre under normal forest management practices, and with location and terrain presenting favorable logging, transportation, and marketing conditions. (D) Fourth class&amp;ndash;Lands of medium suitability for growth of merchantable timber having mean annual growth potential in amounts such as five hundred to one thousand board feet per acre under normal forest management practices, and with location and terrain presenting less favorable logging, transportation, and marketing conditions. (E) Fifth class&amp;ndash;Lands of relatively low suitability for growth of merchantable timber having mean annual growth potential less than an amount such as five hundred board feet per acre, and with location and terrain presenting favorable logging, transportation, and marketing conditions. (F) Sixth class&amp;ndash;Lands of relatively low suitability for growth of merchantable timber having mean annual growth potential less than an amount such as five hundred board feet per acre, and with location and terrain presenting less favorable logging, transportation, and marketing conditions. 5. Quarry use Lands having sufficient quantity and quality of rock, gravel, and sand for purpose of commercial use. 6. Mining use Lands bearing sufficient quantity and quality of mineral products for purpose of commercial mining and use. 7. Recreational use Lands suitable for use and development as parks, playgrounds, historical sites, natural area, camp grounds, wildlife refuge, scenic sites, and other such uses. 8.
