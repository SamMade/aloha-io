<p>(3) Land to which the University of Hawaii holds title;</p>

<p>(4) Land to which the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation in its corporate capacity holds title;</p>

<p>(5) Land to which the department of agriculture holds title by way of foreclosure, voluntary surrender, or otherwise, to recover moneys loaned or to recover debts otherwise owed the department under chapter 167;</p>

<p>(6) Land that is set aside by the governor to the Aloha Tower development corporation; or land to which the Aloha Tower development corporation holds title in its corporate capacity;</p>

<p>(b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, no sale of lands described in subsection (a) in fee simple including land sold for roads and streets, or gift of lands described in subsection (a) in fee simple to the extent such gift is otherwise permitted by law, shall occur without the prior approval of the sale or gift by the legislature by concurrent resolution to be adopted by each house by at least a two-thirds majority vote of the members to which each house is entitled in a regular or special session at which a concurrent resolution is submitted for approval of the sale; provided that the provisions of this section shall not apply to remnants, as that term is defined in section 171-52, or portions thereof; provided further that this section shall not apply to the issuance of licenses, permits, easements, and leases executed in conformance with the laws applicable to the lands listed in subsection (a); provided further that this section shall not apply to non-ceded lands conveyed to the University of Hawaii after December 31, 1989, to which the University of Hawaii holds title; provided further that this section shall not apply to reserved housing, as that term is defined in section 206E-101, conveyed by the Hawaii community development authority.</p>

<p>&copy; The state department or agency proposing to sell or give any state land described in subsection (a) shall submit for introduction to the legislature a concurrent resolution for review of the proposed sale or gift.

<p>A draft of the concurrent resolution for the prior approval of a sale or gift of land shall also be submitted to the office of Hawaiian affairs at least three months prior to the convening of a regular or special session of the legislature to allow the office to determine whether the land was classed as government or crown lands previous to August 15, 1895, or was acquired by the State in exchange for such lands.</p>

<p>(d) If the legislature fails to approve the concurrent resolution by at least a two-thirds majority vote of both houses, the transaction shall be abandoned by the state department or agency.</p>

<p>(e) Prior to finalizing any proposal for the sale or gift of lands described in subsection (a) to a person or entity other than the State, its agencies, or its entities, and prior to submission of the concurrent resolution to the legislature under subsection &copy;, the State, agency, or entity, as appropriate, shall hold an informational briefing on the proposed sale or gift in the community where the land to be sold or given is located.</p>
