<p>A draft of the concurrent resolution for the prior approval of a sale or gift of land shall also be submitted to the office of Hawaiian affairs at least three months prior to the convening of a regular or special session of the legislature to allow the office to determine whether the land was classed as government or crown lands previous to August 15, 1895, or was acquired by the State in exchange for such lands.</p>

<p>(d) If the legislature fails to approve the concurrent resolution by at least a two-thirds majority vote of both houses, the transaction shall be abandoned by the state department or agency.</p>

<p>(e) Prior to finalizing any proposal for the sale or gift of lands described in subsection (a) to a person or entity other than the State, its agencies, or its entities, and prior to submission of the concurrent resolution to the legislature under subsection &copy;, the State, agency, or entity, as appropriate, shall hold an informational briefing on the proposed sale or gift in the community where the land to be sold or given is located.</p>
