To qualify for a residential lease under this part, the lessee shall: (1) Be of legal age and have at least one person, related to the lessee by blood or marriage and solely dependent upon the lessee for support, who will occupy the premises with the lessee; provided that this requirement shall not apply to a husband and wife or to reciprocal beneficiaries who are joint lessees, even if both are employed; (2) Be a citizen and a resident of the State for not less than five years immediately preceding the issuance of the lease; (3) Have a gross income not in excess of $20,000 a year, including the gross income of the lessee&amp;rsquo;s spouse or reciprocal beneficiary. In determining gross income, the standard income tax exemption for each of the lessee&amp;rsquo;s dependents, as determined by the income tax laws of the State, shall be allowed; and (4) Have such other qualifications as may be established by the board of land and natural resources. Any person who, after taking a residential lease, through change or circumstances, loses the qualifications initially required of the person or becomes disqualified to take a residential lease, shall not thereby be required to surrender the person&amp;rsquo;s residential lease, but shall be entitled to continue to hold the same.
