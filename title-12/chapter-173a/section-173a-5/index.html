      <p><strong>§173A-5</strong> <strong>Land conservation fund.</strong> (a) A land conservation fund, hereinafter called &ldquo;fund&rdquo;, is hereby established.</p>

<p>(b) The proceeds from the sale of any general obligation bonds authorized and issued for purposes of this chapter shall be deposited in or credited to the fund.</p>

Moneys received as a deposit or private contribution shall be deposited, used, and accounted for in accordance with the conditions established by the agency or person making the contribution.</p>

<p>(f) The fund shall be administered and managed by the department.</p>

<p>(g) The acquisition of interests or rights in land having value as a resource to the State for the preservation of the following shall constitute a public purpose for which public funds may be expended or advanced:</p>

<p>(i) Based on applications from state agencies, counties, and nonprofit land conservation organizations, the department, in consultation with the senate president and speaker of the house of representatives, shall recommend to the board specific parcels of land to be acquired, restricted with conservation easements, or preserved in similar fashion.
