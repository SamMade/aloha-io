<p>(1) Formulate plans, including objectives, criteria to measure accomplishment of objectives, programs through which the objectives are to be attained, and financial requirements for the optimum development of Hawaii&rsquo;s energy resources;</p>

<p>(2) Conduct systematic analysis of existing and proposed energy resource programs, evaluate the analysis conducted by government agencies and other organizations and recommend programs that represent the most effective allocation of resources for the development of energy resources;</p>

<p>(3) Formulate and recommend specific proposals, as necessary, for conserving energy resources, including the allocation and distribution thereof;</p>

<p>(4) Assist public and private agencies in implementing energy conservation and efficiency programs, the development of indigenous energy resources, and related measures;</p>

<p>(5) Coordinate the State&rsquo;s energy programs with those of the federal government, other state governments, governments of nations with interest in common energy resources, and the political subdivisions of the State;</p>

<p>(6) Develop programs to encourage private and public exploration, research, and development of indigenous energy resources that will benefit the State;</p>

<p>(7) Conduct public education programs to inform the public of the energy resources situation, as it may exist, from time to time and of the government actions taken;</p>

<p>(8) Serve as consultant to the governor, public agencies, and private industry on energy-related matters;</p>

<p>(9) Contract for services when required for the implementation of this chapter;</p>

<p>(11) Prepare and submit an annual report and other reports as may be requested to the governor and to the legislature on the implementation of this chapter and all matters related to energy resources;</p>

<p>(12) Formulate a systematic process, including the development of requirements, to identify geographic areas that are rich with renewable energy resource potential that can be developed in a cost-effective and environmentally benign manner and designate these areas as renewable energy zones;</p>

<p>(13) Develop and recommend incentives, plans, and programs to encourage the development of renewable energy resource projects within the renewable energy zones;</p>

<p>(14) Assist public and private agencies in identifying utility transmission projects or infrastructure required to accommodate and facilitate the development of renewable energy resources;</p>

<p>(15) Assist public and private agencies, in coordination with the department of budget and finance, in accessing the use of special purpose revenue bonds to finance the engineering, design, and construction of transmission projects and infrastructure that are deemed critical to the development of renewable energy resources;</p>

<p>(16) Develop the criteria or requirements for identifying and qualifying specific transmission projects and infrastructure that are critical to the development of renewable energy resources, including providing assistance in accessing the use of special purpose revenue bonds to finance the projects or infrastructure;</p>

<p>(17) Develop and maintain a comprehensive and systematic quantitative and qualitative capacity to analyze the status of energy resources, systems, and markets, both in-state and those to which Hawaii is directly tied, particularly in relation to the State&rsquo;s economy, and to recommend, develop proposals for, and assess the effectiveness of policy and regulatory decisions, and conduct energy emergency planning; and</p>

<p>(18) Adopt rules for the administration of this chapter pursuant to chapter 91. [L 1974, c 237, §4; am L 1978, c 136, §2; gen ch 1985; am L 2009, c 153, §4 and c 155, §5]</p>
