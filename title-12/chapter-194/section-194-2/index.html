<p>(13) Review state agency mandates and commercial interests that sometimes call for the maintenance of potentially destructive alien species as resources for sport hunting, aesthetic resources, or other values;</p>

<p>(14) Review the structure of fines and penalties to ensure maximum deterrence for invasive species-related crimes;</p>

<p>(15) Suggest appropriate legislation to improve the State&rsquo;s administration of invasive species programs and policies;</p>
