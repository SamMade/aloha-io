(a) The board may lease state marine waters for marine activities upon compliance with section 171-53 and with the concurrence of the director of transportation. Leases may be issued only for marine activities which are allowed pursuant to an approved application. The board shall make a determination that each lease is a commercial or noncommercial lease. (b) The board shall not lease state marine waters when existing programs of the department, such as the marine life conservation district program, shoreline fisheries management area program, or the natural area reserve program will suffer adverse impacts as a consequence of the proposed activities; provided that no lease shall be awarded within state marine waters designated as being necessary for national defense purposes, as determined by the department in consultation with the appropriate federal agencies. &amp;copy; The board shall not lease state marine waters unless the board finds that a lease for the proposed activity, after detailed consideration of the present uses, is clearly in the public interest upon consideration of the overall economic, social, and environmental impacts and consistent with other state policy goals and objectives. (d) The board shall not lease state marine waters unless the board finds that the applicant for a lease has complied with applicable federal, state, and county statutes, ordinances, and rules. (e) The board may require any person who has obtained approval of an application for marine activities or the operation of an OTEC facility in state marine waters to enter into a lease for the conduct of those activities. (f) The board shall not approve an application, if in so doing it would fail to protect the public&amp;rsquo;s use and enjoyment of the reefs in the state marine waters.
