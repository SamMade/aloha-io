The following terms, whenever used and referred to in this chapter, shall have the following meanings, unless a different meaning clearly appears in the context: &amp;ldquo;Application approval&amp;rdquo; means authorization in writing issued by the board to an owner who has applied to the board for permission to construct, enlarge, repair, alter, remove, maintain, or operate a dam or reservoir and that specifies the condition or limitations under which work is to be performed by the owner or under which approval is granted. &amp;ldquo;Appurtenant works&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;appurtenance&amp;rdquo; means any structure, such as spillways in the dam or separate therefrom, the reservoir and its rim, low level outlet works, and water conduits, such as tunnels, pipelines, or penstocks, through the dam or its abutment. &amp;ldquo;Board&amp;rdquo; means the board of land and natural resources. &amp;ldquo;Certificate of approval to impound&amp;rdquo; means authorization in writing issued by the board to an owner of an existing dam or reservoir, or an owner who has completed construction, enlargement, repair, or alteration of a dam or reservoir, that specifies the conditions or limitations under which the dam or reservoir is to be maintained and operated. &amp;ldquo;Dam&amp;rdquo; means any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works that impounds or diverts water and that: (1) Is twenty-five feet or more in height from the natural bed of the stream or watercourse measured at the downstream toe of the barrier, or from the lowest elevation of the outside limit of the barrier if it is not across a stream channel or watercourse to a maximum water storage elevation; (2) Has an impounding capacity at maximum water storage elevation of fifty acre-feet or more. This chapter shall not apply to any artificial barrier that is less than six feet in height regardless of storage capacity or that has a storage capacity at maximum water storage elevation less than fifteen acre-feet regardless of height; or (3) Meets additional criteria or is specifically exempt as determined pursuant to rules adopted by the board. &amp;ldquo;Department&amp;rdquo; means the department of land and natural resources. &amp;ldquo;Emergency&amp;rdquo; includes but is not limited to breaches and all conditions leading to or causing a breach, overtopping, or any other condition in a dam or reservoir and its appurtenant works that may be construed as unsafe or threatening to life and property. &amp;ldquo;Enlargement&amp;rdquo; means any change in or addition to an existing dam or reservoir that raises or may raise the water storage elevation of the water impounded by the dam or reservoir. &amp;ldquo;Hazard potential&amp;rdquo; means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to the failure of the dam or reservoir or the misoperation of the dam, reservoir, or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam or reservoir shall not reflect in any way on the current condition of the dam or reservoir and its appurtenant works, including the dam&amp;rsquo;s or reservoir&amp;rsquo;s safety, structural integrity, or flood routing capacity. &amp;ldquo;High hazard&amp;rdquo; means a dam&amp;rsquo;s or reservoir&amp;rsquo;s failure will result in probable loss of human life. &amp;ldquo;Low hazard&amp;rdquo; means a dam&amp;rsquo;s or reservoir&amp;rsquo;s failure will result in no probable loss of human life and low economic loss or environmental loss, or both. Economic losses are principally limited to the owner&amp;rsquo;s property. &amp;ldquo;Operator&amp;rdquo; means any person who controls, manages, maintains, or supervises the condition and functions of a dam or reservoir. &amp;ldquo;Owner&amp;rdquo; means any person who has a right, title, or interest in or to the dam or reservoir or to the property upon which the dam, reservoir, or appurtenant works is located or proposed to be located. &amp;ldquo;Person&amp;rdquo; means any natural person, partnership, firm, association, organization, corporation, county, county authority, trust, receiver or trustee, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or company, or any state department, agency, or political subdivision, or any other commercial or legal entity.

If by a roadway, the roadway shall be maintained in an accessible condition by a four-wheel drive vehicle even during inclement weather conditions. &amp;ldquo;Probable&amp;rdquo; means more likely than not to occur; reasonably expected; realistic. &amp;ldquo;Removal&amp;rdquo; means complete or partial elimination of the dam or reservoir embankment or structure to restore the approximate original topographic contours of the valley. &amp;ldquo;Reservoir&amp;rdquo; means any basin that contains or will contain water impounded by a dam, including appurtenant works. &amp;ldquo;Significant hazard&amp;rdquo; means a dam&amp;rsquo;s or reservoir&amp;rsquo;s failure will result in no probable loss of human life but can cause major economic loss, environmental damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or impact other concerns. Significant hazard potential classification dams or reservoirs are often located in predominantly rural or agricultural areas but could be located in areas with population and significant infrastructure.
