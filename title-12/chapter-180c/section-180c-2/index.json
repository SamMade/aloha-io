(2) Include such survey of land and waters as may be deemed appropriate by the county or required by any applicable law to identify areas including multi-jurisdictional and watershed areas with critical erosion and sediment problems. (3) Contain standards for various types of soil and land uses, which standards shall include criteria, techniques, and methods for the control of erosion and sediment resulting from land disturbing activities. (4) Include a provision whereby standards shall be deemed met if it can be shown that the land is being managed in accordance with soil conservation practices acceptable to the applicable soil and water conservation district directors, and that a comprehensive conservation program is being actively pursued. [L 1974, c 249, pt of ยง2] Case Notes The public trust duties imposed on the State under article XI, ยง1 of the Hawaii constitution also applied to the county, as a political subdivision of the State; article XI, ยง1 mandates that the county has an obligation to conserve and protect the State&amp;rsquo;s natural resources; the county&amp;rsquo;s power under the general laws with respect to its public trust duty to protect the natural resources of the State can be found in this chapter; thus, the county had a duty to protect the waters located adjacent to defendant&amp;rsquo;s property. 111 H. 205, 140 P.3d 985.
