  "context": "§804-7.1 Conditions of release on bail, recognizance, or supervised release. Upon a showing that there exists a danger that the defendant will commit a serious crime or will seek to intimidate witnesses, or will otherwise unlawfully interfere with the orderly administration of justice, the judicial officer named in section 804-5 may deny the defendant&amp;rsquo;s release on bail, recognizance, or supervised release. Upon the defendant&amp;rsquo;s release on bail, recognizance, or supervised release, however, the court may enter an order: (1) Prohibiting the defendant from approaching or communicating with particular persons or classes of persons, except that no such order should be deemed to prohibit any lawful and ethical activity of defendant&amp;rsquo;s counsel; (2) Prohibiting the defendant from going to certain described geographical areas or premises; (3) Prohibiting the defendant from possessing any dangerous weapon, engaging in certain described activities, or indulging in intoxicating liquors or certain drugs; (4) Requiring the defendant to report regularly to and remain under the supervision of an officer of the court; (5) Requiring the defendant to maintain employment, or, if unemployed, to actively seek employment, or attend an educational or vocational institution; (6) Requiring the defendant to comply with a specified curfew; (7) Requiring the defendant to seek and maintain mental health treatment or testing, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, or to remain in a specified institution for that purpose; (8) Requiring the defendant to remain in the jurisdiction of the judicial circuit in which the charges are pending unless approval is obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction to leave the jurisdiction of the court; (9) Requiring the defendant to satisfy any other condition reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the person as required and to assure the safety of any other person or community; or (10) Imposing any combination of conditions listed above. The judicial officer may revoke a defendant&amp;rsquo;s bail upon proof that the defendant has breached any of the conditions imposed.

Rev. 63 (2001). Case Notes Where restrictions imposed by the trial court were a condition of defendant&amp;rsquo;s bail, defendant&amp;rsquo;s argument that prohibition was overbroad, vague, ambiguous and therefore unconstitutional, was unpersuasive and restrictions imposed were well within the discretion of the trial court. 79 H. 150, 900 P.2d 157 (1995).
