      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Duties upon discharge, parole, or release of covered offender</h2>
      <p><strong>§846E-4</strong> <strong>Duties upon discharge, parole, or release of covered offender.</strong> (a) Each person, or that person&rsquo;s designee, in charge of a jail, prison, hospital, school, or other institution to which a covered offender has been committed pursuant to a conviction, or an acquittal or finding of unfitness to proceed pursuant to chapter 704, for a covered offense, and each judge, or that judge&rsquo;s designee, who continues bail for or releases a covered offender following sentencing and the entry of a judgment of conviction, who releases a covered offender on probation or who discharges a covered offender upon payment of a fine, and each agency having jurisdiction, shall, prior to the discharge, parole, or release of the covered offender:</p>

<p>(1) Explain to the covered offender the duty to register and the consequences of failing to register under this chapter;</p>

<p>(2) Obtain from the covered offender all of the registration information required by this chapter;</p>

<p>(3) Inform the covered offender that if at any time the covered offender changes any of the covered offender&rsquo;s registration information, the covered offender shall notify the attorney general of the new registration information in writing within three working days;</p>

<p>(4) Inform the covered offender that, if at any time the covered offender changes residence to another state, the covered offender shall register the new address with the attorney general and also with a designated law enforcement agency in the new state, if the new state has a registration requirement, within the period of time mandated by the new state&rsquo;s sex offender registration laws;</p>

<p>(5) Obtain and verify fingerprints and a photograph of the covered offender, if these have not already been obtained or verified in connection with the offense that triggers the registration;</p>

<p>(6) Require the covered offender to sign a statement indicating that the duty to register has been explained to the covered offender; and</p>

<p>(7) Give one copy of the signed statement and one copy of the registration information to the covered offender.</p>

<p>(b) No covered offender required to register under this chapter shall be discharged, released from any confinement, or placed on parole or probation unless the requirements of subsection (a) have been satisfied and all registration information required under section 846E-2 has been obtained.</p>

<p>&copy; Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a copy of the signed statement and one copy of the registration information shall be transmitted to the attorney general within three working days.</p>

<p>(d) Following receipt of the information from the agency having jurisdiction over the covered offender, the attorney general immediately shall enter the information into a statewide record system, unless the information has been previously entered into a statewide record system, and notify the county police department or appropriate law enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the covered offender expects to reside. The attorney general immediately shall transmit the conviction data and verified fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, unless the items have been previously transmitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>(e) The chief of police shall transmit any covered offender registration information required by this chapter to the attorney general, by entering the information into a statewide record system, if the information has not previously been entered into the system, and also shall provide the attorney general with a photograph and fingerprints of the covered offender, taken at the time the covered offender registers with the chief of police. The covered offender shall report in person every five years until June 30, 2009, and beginning on July 1, 2009, every year, within the thirty-day period following the offender&rsquo;s date of birth, to the chief of police where the covered offender&rsquo;s residence is located, or to such other department or agency that may be designated by the attorney general in rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 for purposes of the administration of this subsection, and shall review the existing information in the registry that is within the offender&rsquo;s knowledge, correct any information that has changed or is inaccurate, provide any new information that may be required, and allow the police and such other department or agency designated by the attorney general to take a current photograph of the offender. [L 1997, c 316, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 194, §§4 to 6; am L 2003, c 62, §§6, 7; am L 2005, c 45, §6; am L 2008, c 80, §7; am L 2013, c 64, §6]</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>The 2013 amendment applies to any acts committed prior to, on, or after April 30, 2013. L 2013, c 64, §11.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not interfere with any of a sex offender&rsquo;s protected liberty interests, the protections of procedural due process are not triggered. 97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255 (2001).</p>
