<p>Note</p>

<p>Applicability of 2011 amendment. L 2011, c 125, §4.</p>

<p>The L 2013, c 64, §3 amendment applies to any acts committed prior to, on, or after April 30, 2013. L 2013, c 64, §11.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Indecent exposure, in violation of §707-734, does not constitute an offense that entails &ldquo;criminal sexual conduct&rdquo; and, consequently, persons convicted of indecent exposure are not &ldquo;sex offenders&rdquo; for purposes of this chapter; thus, defendant was not required to register as a &ldquo;sex offender&rdquo; pursuant to this chapter. 102 H. 383, 76 P.3d 935 (2003).</p>

<p>Under article I, §5, of the Hawaii constitution, due process requires that a convicted sex offender under this section be afforded the right to a judicial hearing at which evidence may be offered to demonstrate that continuance of all or part of the lifetime registration requirements are not necessary in a particular case to fulfill the public need to which the sex offender act responded. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>

<p>Defendant argued that §707-756 was void for vagueness because &ldquo;it refers to a confusing labyrinth of language in [this section] that results in guesswork and differences in opinion&rdquo;. There was no constitutionally-infirm vagueness in the &ldquo;comparable to&rdquo; language of the catchall provisions in the definitions of &ldquo;crime against minors&rdquo; and &ldquo;sexual offense&rdquo; (2012); however, the language regarding a criminal offense that &ldquo;exceeds&rdquo; one of the specifically-described offenses was unconstitutionally vague. Because defendant&rsquo;s behavior fell under a &ldquo;clearly proscribed&rdquo; &ldquo;covered offense&rdquo;, the &ldquo;exceeds&rdquo; language in this section was unnecessary to sustain a conviction against defendant and defendant could not complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to defendant. The second part of the catchall provisions contained some redundancy in the application to §707-756(1), but the criminal prohibition was clear. 131 H. 312 (App.), 318 P.3d 602 (2013).</p>

<p>Where it was not necessary for defendant to actually commit one of the felony offenses defined in this section in order to violate the prohibition against the electronic enticement of a child under §707-756(1) but only necessary under §707-756(1)(b)(iii) that defendant act with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony offense defined in this section, the State was not required to specify in the indictment which felony offense defined in this section that defendant intended to promote or facilitate. 120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).</p>
