[L 1997, c 316, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 194, §2; am L 2002, c 234, §1; am L 2003, c 62, §4; am L 2004, c 59, §2; am L 2005, c 45, §4; am L 2006, c 106, §2; am L 2008, c 80, §5; am L 2013, c 64, §5] Note The 2013 amendment applies to any acts committed prior to, on, or after April 30, 2013. L 2013, c 64, §11. Case Notes As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not interfere with any of a sex offender&amp;rsquo;s protected liberty interests, the protections of procedural due process are not triggered. 97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255 (2001). The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the Hawaii constitution, article I, §5 and requires that minimum requirements of due process&amp;ndash;notice and opportunity to be heard&amp;ndash;be afforded to convicted sex offenders; such a proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special proceeding. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).
