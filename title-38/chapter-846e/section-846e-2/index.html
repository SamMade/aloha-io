      <p><strong>§846E-2 Registration requirements.</strong> (a) A covered offender shall register with the attorney general and comply with the provisions of this chapter for life or for a shorter period of time as provided in this chapter. Registration under this subsection is required whenever the covered offender, whether or not a resident of this State, remains in this State for more than ten days or for an aggregate period exceeding thirty days in one calendar year. A covered offender shall be eligible to petition the court in a civil proceeding for an order that the covered offender&rsquo;s registration requirements under this chapter be terminated, as provided in section 846E-10.</p>

<p>(b) A person who establishes or maintains a residence in this State and who has not been designated as a covered offender by a court of this State but who has been designated as a covered offender, sex offender, offender against minors, repeat covered offender, sexually violent predator, or any other sexual offender designation in another state or jurisdiction and was, as a result of such designation, subjected to registration or community or public notification, or both, or would be if the person was a resident of that state or jurisdiction, without regard to whether the person otherwise meets the criteria for registration as a covered offender, shall register in the manner provided in this section and shall be subject to community and public notification as provided in section 846E-3. A person who meets the criteria of this subsection is subject to the requirements and penalty provisions of section 846E-9 until the person successfully petitions the attorney general for termination of registration requirements by:</p>

<p>(1) Providing an order issued by the court that designated the person as a covered offender, sex offender, offender against minors, repeat covered offender, sexually violent predator, or any other sexual offender designation in the state or jurisdiction in which the order was issued, which states that such designation has been removed or demonstrates to<a></a> the attorney general that such designation, if not imposed by a court, has been removed by operation of law or court order in the state or jurisdiction in which the designation was made, and such person does not meet the criteria for registration as a covered offender under the laws of this State; or</p>

<p>(2) Demonstrating that the out-of-state convictions upon which the sexual offender designation was established are not covered offenses under section 846E-1, thereby showing that such person does not meet the criteria for registration as a covered offender under the laws of this State.</p>

<p>If the covered offender is not satisfied with the decision of the attorney general on the request for termination of registration requirements, the covered offender may appeal the decision pursuant to chapter 91.</p>

<p>&copy; Each provision of this chapter applicable to sex offenders shall also be applicable to offenders against minors, unless offenders against minors are specifically excluded. Whenever a covered offender&rsquo;s public information is made publicly accessible, separate registries shall be maintained for:</p>

<p>(1) Sex offenders; and</p>

<p>(2) Offenders against minors.</p>

<p>(d) Registration information for each covered offender shall include a signed statement by the covered offender containing:</p>

<p>(1) The name, all prior names, nicknames and pseudonyms, and all aliases used by the covered offender or under which the covered offender has been known and other identifying information, including date of birth and any alias date of birth, social security number and any alias social security number, sex, race, height, weight, and hair and eye color;</p>

<p>(2) The actual address and telephone number of the covered offender&rsquo;s permanent residence or the address of the covered offender&rsquo;s current temporary residence, or if an address is not available, a description of the place or area in which the covered offender resides for at least thirty nonconsecutive days within a sixty-day period, and for each address or place where the covered offender resides, how long the covered offender has resided there;</p>

<p>(3) The actual address or description of the place or area, the actual length of time of the stay, and telephone number where the covered offender is staying for a period of more than ten days, if other than the stated residence;</p>

<p>(4) If known, the future address and telephone number of the place where the covered offender is planning to reside, if other than the stated residence;</p>

<p>(5) Any electronic mail address, any instant message name, any internet designation or moniker, and any internet address used for routing or self-identification;</p>

<p>(6) Any cell phone number and other designations used for routing or self-identification in telephonic communications;</p>

<p>(7) Names and, if known, actual business addresses of current and known future employers, including information for any place where the covered offender works as a volunteer or otherwise works without remuneration, and the starting and ending dates of any such employment;</p>

<p>(9) Professional licenses held by the covered offender;</p>

<p>(10) Names and actual addresses of current and known future educational institutions with which the covered offender is affiliated in any way, whether or not compensated, including but not limited to affiliation as a faculty member, an employee, or a student, and the starting and ending dates of any such affiliation;</p>

<p>(11) The year, make, model, color, and license or registration or other identifying number of all vehicles, including automobiles, watercrafts, and aircrafts, currently owned or operated by the covered offender and the address or description of the place or places where the covered offender&rsquo;s vehicle or vehicles are habitually parked, docked, or otherwise kept;</p>

<p>(12) Passports and information about the passports, if the covered offender has passports, and documents establishing immigration status and information about these documents, if the covered offender is an alien;</p>

<p>(13) A statement listing all covered offenses for which the covered offender has been convicted or found unfit to proceed or acquitted pursuant to chapter 704;</p>

<p>(14) A statement indicating whether the covered offender has received or is currently receiving treatment ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the Hawaii paroling authority;</p>

<p>(15) A statement indicating whether the covered offender is a United States citizen; and</p>

<p>(16) Any additional identifying information about the covered offender.</p>

<p>(e) The following information shall also be included in the registry for each covered offender:</p>

<p>(2) A physical description of the covered offender, including a description of particular identifying characteristics such as scars or tattoos;</p>

<p>(3) Confirmation that the covered offender has provided digitized fingerprints and palm prints of the covered offender;</p>

<p>(6) The criminal history of the covered offender, or an electronic link to the criminal history, including the date of all<a></a> arrests and convictions, the status of parole, probation, or supervised release, registration status, and the existence of any outstanding arrest warrants for the covered offender;</p>

<p>(7) Confirmation that the covered offender has provided a DNA buccal swab sample as required by chapter 844D;</p>

<p>(8) Digitized copies of a valid driver&rsquo;s license or identification card issued to the covered offender, or an electronic link to such records; and</p>

<p>(9) Digitized copies of passports and documents establishing immigration status, or an electronic link to such records.</p>

<p>(f) Whenever a covered offender provides registration information, during initial registration as a covered offender or when providing notice of a change in registration information, the covered offender also shall sign a statement verifying that all of the registration information is accurate and current.</p>

<p>(g) In addition to the requirement under subsection (a) to register with the attorney general and comply with the provisions of this chapter until a court relieves the covered offender of the registration requirements of this chapter, each covered offender shall also register in person with the chief of police where the covered offender resides or is present.  Registration under this subsection is for the purpose of providing the covered offender&rsquo;s photograph, fingerprints, and registration information. Registration under this subsection is required whenever the covered offender, whether or not a resident of this State, remains in this State for more than ten days or for an aggregate period exceeding thirty days in one calendar year.  Covered offenders required to register in person with the chief of police under this subsection shall register no later than three working days after the earliest of:</p>

<p>(4) Release on furlough;</p>

<p>(8) Arrival in a county in which the covered offender resides or expects to be present for a period exceeding ten days.</p>

<p>In addition to any other requirement to register under this subsection or subsection (a), each covered offender shall report in person every five years until June 30, 2009, and beginning on July 1, 2009, every year, within the thirty-day period following the offender&rsquo;s date of birth, to the chief of police where the covered offender resides, or to such other department or agency that may be designated by the attorney general in rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 for purposes of the administration of this subsection, and shall review the existing information in the registry that is within the offender&rsquo;s knowledge, correct any information that has changed or is inaccurate, provide any new information that may be required, and allow the police and such other department or agency designated by the attorney general to take a current photograph of the offender.</p>

<p>(h) The registration provisions of this section shall apply to all covered offenders without regard to:</p>

<p>(1) The date of the covered offender&rsquo;s conviction;</p>

<p>(2) The date of finding, pursuant to chapter 704, of the covered offender&rsquo;s unfitness to proceed; or</p>

<p>(3) The date of the covered offender&rsquo;s acquittal due to mental disease, disorder, or defect, pursuant to chapter 704. [L 1997, c 316, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 194, §2; am L 2002, c 234, §1; am L 2003, c 62, §4; am L 2004, c 59, §2; am L 2005, c 45, §4; am L 2006, c 106, §2; am L 2008, c 80, §5; am L 2013, c 64, §5]</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>The 2013 amendment applies to any acts committed prior to, on, or after April 30, 2013. L 2013, c 64, §11.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not interfere with any of a sex offender&rsquo;s protected liberty interests, the protections of procedural due process are not triggered. 97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255 (2001).</p>

<p>The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the Hawaii constitution, article I, §5 and requires that minimum requirements of due process&ndash;notice and opportunity to be heard&ndash;be afforded to convicted sex offenders; such a proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special proceeding. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>
