  "context": "ยง803-48.5 Injunction against illegal interception. Whenever it appears that any person is engaged or is about to engage in any act that constitutes or will constitute a felony violation of this part, the attorney general may initiate a civil action in a circuit court of this State to enjoin the violation. The court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and make a determination of the action; provided that at any time before final determination, the court may enter a restraining order or take any other action that is warranted to prevent a continuing and substantial injury to the State or to any person or class of persons for whose protection the action is brought. A proceeding under this section is governed by the Hawaii rules of civil procedure; except that, if an indictment, information, or criminal complaint has been returned against the respondent, discovery shall be governed by the Hawaii rules of penal procedure.
