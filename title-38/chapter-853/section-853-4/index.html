[L 1976, c 154, pt of §2; am L 1980, c 292, §2; am L 1993, c 130, §4 and c 234, §1; am L 1996, c 201, §3; am L 1997, c 55, §1; am L 1998, c 172, §9; am L 2000, c 4, §7; am L 2004, c 85, §1; am L 2005, c 203, §25; am L 2006, c 80, §4; am L 2007, c 288, §3; am L 2008, c 171, §11; am L 2009, c 88, §13; am L 2010, c 166, §22 and c 211, §§7, 8, 13; am L 2011, c 145, §5; am L 2013, c 53, §1; am L 2014, c 114, §5; am L 2016, c 206, §20 and c 231, §68]</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Paragraph (7) is limited to cases involving minors who were waived for adult prosecution under §571-22. 61 H. 385, 605 P.2d 496 (1980).</p>

<p>Subsections are not to be read conjunctively. 69 H. 602, 752 P.2d 597 (1988).</p>

<p>As sentencing court limited to alternatives expressly enumerated in §188-70 and probation not an enumerated alternative, offense of fishing with gill nets under §188-30.2 nonprobationable; thus, under paragraph (5), deferred acceptance of no contest plea not allowed for that offense. 87 H. 102, 952 P.2d 390 (1998).</p>

<p>The plain and unambiguous language of paragraph (2) does not prohibit the grant of a deferred acceptance of no contest plea for assault in the second degree under §707-711 causing &ldquo;substantial bodily injury&rdquo;, as statutory prohibition expressly applies only to felony and misdemeanor assaults inflicting &ldquo;bodily injury&rdquo; or &ldquo;serious bodily injury&rdquo;. 101 H. 409, 70 P.3d 635 (2003).</p>

<p>By the express terms of §712-1207(4) and (5), the offense of street solicitation under §712-1207(1) is probationable, and thus not excludable under paragraph (5); appeals court therefore erred in affirming trial court&rsquo;s refusal to consider defendant&rsquo;s motion for a deferred acceptance of no contest plea. 116 H. 519, 174 P.3d 358 (2007).</p>

<p>When family court implicitly entered a deferred acceptance of guilty plea pursuant to §853-1 and conditioned deferral upon defendant&rsquo;s submitting to counseling according to schedule and not committing any subsequent offenses, family court violated paragraph (2), where defendant was charged with abuse of family and household member (§709-906). 10 H. App. 148, 861 P.2d 759 (1993).</p>

<p>Where the indictment alleges that a &ldquo;dangerous instrument&rdquo; was used in the commission of the offense charged so as to allow proof that a &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; was used, the possibility exists that the defendant is not eligible for a deferred acceptance of no contest (DANC) plea; in such cases, if prior to the court&rsquo;s decision on the defendant&rsquo;s motion for a DANC plea the court is informed that the &ldquo;dangerous instrument&rdquo; was a &ldquo;firearm&rdquo;, the defendant is not eligible for, and the court is not authorized to enter, a DANC plea. 101 H. 65 (App.), 62 P.3d 628 (2002).</p>

<p>Mentioned: 74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776 (1992).</p>
