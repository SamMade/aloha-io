Case Notes A conditional plea under HRPP rule 11(a)(2) is inconsistent with the granting of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea pursuant to this chapter; defendant&amp;rsquo;s appeal from trial court&amp;rsquo;s order granting motion for deferred plea did not provide a jurisdictional basis for review of an adverse pretrial suppression order purportedly preserved by the trial court&amp;rsquo;s allowance of defendant&amp;rsquo;s conditional plea. 95 H. 309, 22 P.3d 588 (2001).
