  "context": "ยง853-3 Violation of terms and conditions during deferment; result. Upon violation of a term or condition set by the court for a deferred acceptance of guilty plea or deferred acceptance of nolo contendere plea, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. [L 1976, c 154, pt of ยง2; am L 1983, c 290, ยง4] Case Notes Because a court&amp;rsquo;s course of action following revocation of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea is expressly set forth in this section, no need or justification arises for resort to any other statute, such as ยง706-625(5). 93 H. 362, 3 P.3d 1239 (2000). Section 706-625(5), which permits a trial court on revocation of probation to impose any sentence that might have originally been imposed at the time of conviction, does not apply to the sentencing procedure attendant to revocation of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea, which is already specifically governed by this section. 93 H. 362, 3 P.3d 1239 (2000). No abuse of discretion where family court concluded that defendant&amp;rsquo;s refusal to take polygraph examination, resulting in defendant&amp;rsquo;s termination from sex offender treatment program, constituted a violation of the terms and conditions of the deferred acceptance of nolo contendere plea order, warranting that it be set aside. 92 H. 289 (App.), 990 P.2d 1171 (1999).
