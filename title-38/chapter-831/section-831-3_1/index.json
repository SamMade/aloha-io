Nothing in this subsection shall abrogate any applicable appeal rights under chapters 76 or 89. (b) The State or any of its branches, political subdivisions, or agencies may consider as a justification for the refusal, suspension, or revocation of any employment or of any permit, license, registration, or certificate, any conviction of any crime, except those which have been expunged, occurring within the past ten years, excluding any period of incarceration, when that crime bears a rational relationship to the duties and responsibilities of the job, occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which a permit, license, registration, or certificate is applied for or held. &amp;copy; The State or any of its branches, political subdivisions, or agencies may consider as a possible justification for the refusal, suspension, or revocation of any employment or of any permit, license, registration, or certificate, any conviction of a crime, not occurring within the past ten years, excluding any period of incarceration, except those which have been expunged, when the offense directly relates to: (1) The applicant&amp;rsquo;s possible performance in the job applied for; (2) The employee&amp;rsquo;s possible performance in the job that the employee holds; or (3) The applicant&amp;rsquo;s or holder&amp;rsquo;s possible performance in the occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which a permit, license, registration, or certificate is applied for or held. For the purpose of this subsection, such refusal, suspension, or revocation may occur only when the agency determines, after investigation in accordance with chapter 91, or in the case of employment in the civil service, after appropriate investigation, notification of results and planned action, and opportunity to meet and rebut the finding, all of which need not be conducted in accordance with chapter 91, that the person so convicted has not been sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant the public trust. (d) When considering noncriminal standards in the granting, renewal, suspension, or revocation of any employment or any such permit, license, registration, or certificate, the State or any of its branches, political subdivisions, or agencies shall not take into consideration the conviction of any crime except as provided by subsections (b) and &amp;copy;. (e) A person who applies for a position in the civil service and is denied employment in that position on the basis of a criminal conviction pursuant to this section, may appeal the adverse decision to the civil service commission or merit appeals board, as appropriate, within twenty days after the notice of action has been sent to the person.
