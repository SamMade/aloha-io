Thereupon the chief of police shall give notice by postcard or other ordinary mail to each such person or attorney whose address or last known address is available, stating briefly that the article (briefly describing the article in general terms) was offered or admitted in evidence, the approximate date of the offer or admission, the name and number of the case and the name of the court, and that, unless the article is called for and proof of ownership made within three months from the date of mailing the notice, the same shall be disposed of for the use of the county. In addition, the chief of police of the county shall publish a notice once in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county, which notice may relate to any number of different items and may be in substantially the following form: Notice of Proposed Forfeiture of Unclaimed Articles Offered or Admitted in Evidence in Criminal Cases in District Courts.
