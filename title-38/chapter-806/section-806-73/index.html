<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Violation of section where prosecutor used confidential presentence report. 70 H. 227, 768 P.2d 759 (1989).</p>

<p>Sentencing court must make a presentence report part of the record in all cases where a report has been prepared, which must be sealed to comply with confidentiality requirements of section. 73 H. 259, 831 P.2d 523 (1992).</p>

<p>Trial court erred in denying defendant&rsquo;s request to disclose victim&rsquo;s adult probation division records or to conduct an in camera review; trial court should have conducted an in camera review of victim&rsquo;s adult probation division records and released to defendant relevant information pertaining to victim&rsquo;s truthfulness and honesty; trial court should have then sealed the remaining portions of the record. 104 H. 89 (App.), 85 P.3d 196 (2004).</p>
