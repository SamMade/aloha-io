In recognition of the civic and moral duty of victims and witnesses of crimes to cooperate fully and voluntarily with law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies, and in further recognition of the continuing importance of such citizen cooperation to state and local law enforcement efforts and the general effectiveness and well-being of the criminal justice system of this State, the legislature declares its intent, in this chapter, to ensure that all victims and witnesses of crimes are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy, and sensitivity and that the rights extended in this chapter to victims and witnesses of crime are honored and protected by law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and judges in a manner no less vigorous than the protections afforded criminal defendants.
