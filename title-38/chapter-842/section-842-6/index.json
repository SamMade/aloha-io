The attorney general may institute civil proceedings in the circuit court to enjoin the operation of any business other than a corporation, including a partnership, limited partnership, unincorporated association, joint venture, or sole proprietorship, when: (1) Any person in control of the business, who may be a partner in a partnership or in a limited partnership, a participant in a joint venture, the owner of a sole proprietorship, an employee or agent of any such business, or a person who, in fact, exercises control over the operations of the business in conducting business affairs, purposely engages in a persistent course of organized crime with the intent to compel or induce other persons, firms, or corporations to deal with the business or engage in organized crime; and (2) The public interest requires the operation of the business to be enjoined, for the prevention of future illegal conduct of the same character.
