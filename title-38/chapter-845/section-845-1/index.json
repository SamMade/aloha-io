The legislature finds that a substantial and disproportionate amount of serious crime is committed against the people by a relatively small number of multiple and repeat felony offenders, commonly known as career criminals. In enacting this chapter, the legislature intends to support increased efforts by prosecuting attorneys&amp;rsquo; offices to prosecute career criminals through organizational and operational techniques that have been proven effective in selected counties in other states.
