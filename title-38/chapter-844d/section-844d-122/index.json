  "context": "[ยง844D-122] Proceedings. The court shall order the prosecuting attorney to answer a motion filed pursuant to section 844D-121 not later than thirty days after filing of the motion. The court may thereafter deny the motion without hearing if the motion is patently frivolous because it is without a trace of support either in the record or in any materials submitted with the motion. The court shall conduct a hearing on the motion within ninety days of its filing if the allegations in the motion, taken as true, establish grounds for relief under section 844D-123. If the court sets the motion for hearing, the court shall order that all evidence in the custody or control of a police department, prosecuting attorney, laboratory, or court that could be subjected to DNA analysis be preserved during the pendency of the proceeding. The intentional destruction of evidence after entry of the order shall constitute grounds for appropriate sanctions, including contempt of court under section 710-1077. [L 2005, c 112, pt of ยง1] "
