      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Order for post-conviction DNA testing</h2>
      <p><strong>[ยง844D-123] Order for post-conviction DNA testing.</strong> (a) The court shall order testing after a hearing if it finds that:</p>

<p>(1) A reasonable probability exists that the defendant would not have been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA analysis, even if the defendant later pled guilty or no contest;</p>

<p>(2) Identity was or should have been an issue in the proceeding that led to the verdict or sentence;</p>

<p>(3) The evidence sought to be analyzed has been identified with particularity and still exists in a condition that permits DNA analysis; provided that questions as to the chain of custody of the evidence shall not constitute grounds to deny the motion if the testing itself can establish the integrity of the evidence;</p>

<p>(4) The evidence was not previously subjected to DNA analysis or was not subjected to analysis that can now resolve an issue not resolved by previous analysis; and</p>

<p>(5) The application for testing is made for the purpose of demonstrating innocence and not to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.</p>

<p>(b) The court may order testing after a hearing if it finds that:</p>

<p>(1) A reasonable probability exists that DNA analysis of the evidence will produce results that would have led to a more favorable verdict or sentence for the defendant had the results been available at the proceeding leading to the verdict or sentence, even if the defendant pled guilty or no contest;</p>

<p>(2) The evidence sought to be analyzed has been identified with particularity and still exists in a condition that permits DNA analysis; provided that questions as to the chain of custody of the evidence shall not constitute grounds to deny the motion if the testing itself can establish the integrity of the evidence;</p>

<p>(3) The evidence was not previously subjected to DNA testing or was not subject to testing that can now resolve an issue not resolved by previous testing; and</p>

<p>(4) The application for testing is made for the purpose of demonstrating that the defendant was guilty of a lesser offense or eligible for a more lenient sentence and not to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.</p>

<p>&copy; If evidence had previously been subjected to DNA analysis, by either the prosecution or defense, the court may order the prosecution or defense to provide each party and the court with access to the laboratory reports prepared in connection with the DNA analysis, as well as the underlying data and laboratory notes. If DNA or other analysis of evidence was previously conducted by either the prosecution or defense without knowledge of the other party, all information relating to the testing shall be disclosed by the motion for analysis or response. If the court orders DNA analysis under this section, the court shall order the production to each party and the court of any laboratory reports prepared in connection with the DNA analysis and, in its discretion, may order production of the underlying data and laboratory notes.
