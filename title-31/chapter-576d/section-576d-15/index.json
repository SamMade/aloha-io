The information provided by the financial institution shall also include the name and last known address of all account holders of any account reported under this section. &amp;copy; In response to a notice of lien or levy, the financial institution, if holding assets on behalf of any noncustodial parent who is subject to a child support lien arising by operation of law against real and personal property for delinquent support owed by the noncustodial parent who resides in or owns property in the State shall accord those liens full faith and credit when the agency or other entity seeking to enforce the lien has complied with the procedural rules of the State and, if applicable, section 501-102, and shall surrender those assets to the agency or other entity seeking to enforce the lien, or encumber those assets in accordance with the lien. (d) The agency may pay a reasonable fee to a financial institution for conducting the data match provided for in this section, not to exceed the actual costs incurred by the institution.

(f) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, a financial institution furnishing a report or providing information to the agency under this section shall not disclose to a depositor or an account holder that the name of such person has been received from or furnished to the agency; provided that an institution may disclose to its depositors or account holders that under the bank match system the agency has the authority to request certain identifying information on certain depositors or account holders. If an institution wilfully violates this section, the institution shall pay to the agency the lesser of $1,000 or the amount on deposit or in the account of the person to whom such disclosure was made. An institution shall incur no obligation or liability to a depositor or account holder or any other person arising from the furnishing of a report or information to the agency under this section, or from the failure to disclose to a depositor or account holder that the name of such person was included in a list furnished by the agency or in a report furnished by the institution to the agency.
