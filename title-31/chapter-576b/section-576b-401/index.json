(a) If a support order entitled to recognition under this chapter has not been issued, a responding tribunal of this State with personal jurisdiction over the parties may issue a support order if: (1) The individual seeking the order resides outside this State; or (2) The support enforcement agency seeking the order is located outside this State. (b) The tribunal may issue a temporary child support order if the tribunal determines that the order is appropriate and the individual ordered to pay is: (1) A presumed father of the child; (2) Petitioning to have paternity adjudicated; (3) Identified as the father of the child through genetic testing; (4) An alleged father who has declined to submit to genetic testing; (5) Shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the father of the child; (6) An acknowledged father as provided by section 584-3.5; (7) The mother of the child; or (8) An individual who has been ordered to pay child support in a previous proceeding and the order has not been reversed or vacated. &amp;copy; Upon finding, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that an obligor owes a duty of support, the tribunal shall issue a support order directed to the obligor and may issue other orders pursuant to section 576B-305. [L 1997, c 295, pt of ยง1; am L 2015, c 77, pt of ยง1] Case Notes If a support order does not already exist pursuant to subsection (a), the provisions of subsection (b) allow the responding tribunal of this State to order the respondent to pay temporary child support if there is sufficient indication, as defined by the statute, that the respondent is indeed the child&amp;rsquo;s parent; thus, the prepetition support awarded by the court was well within the powers afforded the court by this chapter. 96 H. 373 (App.), 31 P.3d 230.
