      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Restraining orders; appointment of master</h2>
      <p><strong>§580-10 Restraining orders; appointment of master.</strong> (a)  When a complaint for annulment, divorce, or separation is filed in this State, on an application by either party, supported by affidavit or a statement made under penalty of perjury, the court, without a hearing, shall:</p>

<p>(1) Order each of the parties to that action to timely provide to the other party full financial and property disclosure on forms provided by the court; and</p>

<p>(2) Order and restrain each of the parties to that action from transferring, encumbering, wasting, or otherwise disposing of any of their property, whether real, personal, or mixed, over and above current income, except as necessary for the ordinary course of a business or for usual current living expenses, without the consent and concurrence of the other party to such action for divorce, or further specific order of the court.  Where restraining orders are issued against the other party to the action, the non-filing party shall be served promptly with the financial restraining order and shall be entitled to a prompt hearing to show cause why the order should not be enforced.</p>

<p>(b) In all actions for annulment, divorce, or separation, the court shall have the power to issue such restraining orders against a person or persons not a party to the action, as shall be reasonably required during the pendency of such action, to preserve the estates of the parties. Where such restraining orders are issued against a person or persons not a party to the action, such persons shall be promptly served with the order and shall be entitled to a prompt hearing within a reasonable time to show cause why such order should not be enforced.</p>

<p>&copy; In all actions for annulment, divorce, or separation, the court shall have the power to appoint a master, or masters, to make preliminary findings and to report to the court on any issue. The written reports of a master shall be available to interested parties and may be received in evidence if no objection is made; or if objection is made, may be received in evidence provided the person or persons responsible for the reports are available for cross-examination as to any matter contained therein. When a report is received in evidence, any party may introduce other evidence supplementing, supporting, modifying, or rebutting the whole or any part of the report.</p>

<p>(d) Whenever it is made to appear to the court after the filing of any complaint, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a party thereto may inflict physical abuse upon, threaten by words or conduct, or harass the other party, the court may issue a restraining order to prevent such physical abuse, threats, or harassment, and shall enjoy in respect thereof the powers pertaining to a court of equity. Where necessary, the order may require either or both of the parties involved to leave the marital residence during the period of the order, and may also restrain the party to whom it is directed from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing the children or other relative of the spouse who may be residing with that spouse at the time of the granting of the restraining order. The order may also restrain a party&rsquo;s agents, servants, employees, attorneys, or other persons in active concert or participation with the respective party.</p>

<p>(1) A knowing or intentional violation of a restraining order issued pursuant to this section is a misdemeanor. A person convicted under this section shall undergo domestic violence intervention at any available domestic violence program as ordered by the court. The court additionally shall sentence a person convicted under this section as follows:</p>

<p>(A) For a first conviction for violation of the restraining order, the person shall serve a mandatory minimum jail sentence of forty-eight hours and be fined not less than $150 nor more than $500; provided that the court shall not sentence a defendant to pay a fine unless the defendant is or will be able to pay the fine; and</p>

<p>(B) For the second and any subsequent conviction for violation of the restraining order, the person shall serve a mandatory minimum jail sentence of thirty days and be fined not less than $250 nor more than $1,000; provided that the court shall not sentence a defendant to pay a fine unless the defendant is or will be able to pay the fine.</p>

<p>Upon conviction and sentencing of the defendant, the court shall order that the defendant immediately be incarcerated to serve the mandatory minimum sentence imposed; provided that the defendant may be admitted to bail pending appeal pursuant to chapter 804. The court may stay the imposition of the sentence if special circumstances exist.</p>

<p>The court may suspend any jail sentence, except for the mandatory sentences under subparagraphs (A) and (B), upon condition that the defendant remain alcohol and drug-free, conviction-free or complete court-ordered assessments or intervention. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the discretion of the judge to impose additional sanctions authorized in sentencing for a misdemeanor offense. All remedies for the enforcement of judgments shall apply to this section.</p>

<p>(2) Any law enforcement officer shall enforce a restraining order issued pursuant to this subsection, including lawfully ordering the restrained party to voluntarily leave for a three-hour cooling off period, or, with or without a warrant, where the law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the restrained party has violated the restraining order, arresting the restrained party.</p>

<p>(e) Any fines collected pursuant to subsection (d) shall be deposited into the spouse and child abuse special account established under section 601-3.6. [L 1947, c 122, §1; RL 1955, §324-35; am L 1966, c 22, §6; <a href="/title-31/chapter-580/section-580-10/">HRS §580-10</a>; am L 1973, c 211, §5(f); am L 1983, c 187, §1 and c 246, §1; am L 1992, c 290, §1; am L 1993, c 6, §24; am L 1999, c 200, §3; am L 2011, c 140, §1]</p>
