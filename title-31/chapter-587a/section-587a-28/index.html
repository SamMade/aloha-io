<p>(2) Order the party who was served to appear on the date of the next scheduled hearing in the case; or</p>

<p>(3) Set a hearing on the oral motion to vacate prior orders, if a party appears at the hearing and moves the court to vacate or modify prior orders. The moving party shall file a written motion and serve the other parties with proper written notice of the motion and the hearing date.</p>

<p>(d) At the return hearing, the court shall decide:</p>

<p>(ii) Order the department to file, within sixty days after the court&rsquo;s finding that aggravated circumstances are present, a motion to terminate parental rights unless the department has documented in the safe family home factors or other written report submitted to the court a compelling reason why it is not in the best interest of the child to file a motion.</p>

<p>(B) If aggravated circumstances are not present or there is a compelling reason why it is not in the best interest of the child to file a motion to terminate parental rights, the court shall order that the department make reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the child&rsquo;s parents and order an appropriate service plan;</p>
