(b) If there is no previous child-custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this chapter and a child-custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203, a child-custody determination made under this section remains in effect until an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203. If a child-custody proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203, a child-custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination, if it so provides, and this State becomes the home state of the child. &amp;copy; If there is a previous child-custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this chapter, or a child-custody proceeding has been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203, any order issued by a court of this State under this section must specify in the order a period that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203.
