<p>&ldquo;Residual parental rights and responsibilities&rdquo; means those rights and responsibilities remaining with the parent after the transfer of legal custody or guardianship of the person, including, but not necessarily limited to, the right to reasonable visitation, consent to adoption or marriage, and the responsibility for support.</p>

<p>The singular includes the plural, the plural the singular, and the masculine the feminine, when consistent with the intent of this chapter. [L 1965, c 232, pt of §1; Supp, §333-2; <a href="/title-31/chapter-571/section-571-2/">HRS §571-2</a>; am L 1972, c 2, pt of §33; am L 1976, c 85, §3; am L 1980, c 303, §§4(1), 5(1), (2); am L 1985, c 209, §6; gen ch 1985; am L 1986, c 297, §5; am L 1987, c 283, §57 and c 316, §1; am L 1996, c 198, §2; am L 2003, c 95, §15(1); am L 2004, c 161, §29; am L 2005, c 22, §40 and c 244, §3; am L 2010, c 135, §7; am L 2011, c 191, §1; am L 2014, c 201, §6]</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>The 2014 amendment applies to delinquent behavior committed on or after July 1, 2014. L 2014, c 201, §21.</p>

<p>Rules of Court</p>

<p>Additional definitions, see HFCR rule 121.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Where defendant, a non-custodial parent, was acting within the defendant&rsquo;s court-prescribed unsupervised visitation time, defendant retained, as a &ldquo;residual parental right&rdquo;, within the meaning of this section, the authority to discipline defendant&rsquo;s child with respect to that child&rsquo;s conduct during the visitation period; thus, defendant was a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; for purposes of §703-309(1). 90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;physical harm&rdquo; encompassed in the definition of family violence in this section would not preclude a parent&rsquo;s right to use force to discipline a child as permitted by §703-309(1), and duty to discipline a child under §577-7(a). 88 H. 200 (App.), 965 P.2d 133.</p>
