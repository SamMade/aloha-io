<p>&ldquo;Residual parental rights and responsibilities&rdquo; means those rights and responsibilities remaining with the parent after the transfer of legal custody or guardianship of the person, including, but not necessarily limited to, the right to reasonable visitation, consent to adoption or marriage, and the responsibility for support.</p>

[L 1965, c 232, pt of ยง1; Supp, ยง333-2; <a href="/title-31/chapter-571/section-571-2/">HRS ยง571-2</a>; am L 1972, c 2, pt of ยง33; am L 1976, c 85, ยง3; am L 1980, c 303, ยงยง4(1), 5(1), (2); am L 1985, c 209, ยง6; gen ch 1985; am L 1986, c 297, ยง5; am L 1987, c 283, ยง57 and c 316, ยง1; am L 1996, c 198, ยง2; am L 2003, c 95, ยง15(1); am L 2004, c 161, ยง29; am L 2005, c 22, ยง40 and c 244, ยง3; am L 2010, c 135, ยง7; am L 2011, c 191, ยง1; am L 2014, c 201, ยง6]</p>

<p>Rules of Court</p>

<p>Additional definitions, see HFCR rule 121.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Where defendant, a non-custodial parent, was acting within the defendant&rsquo;s court-prescribed unsupervised visitation time, defendant retained, as a &ldquo;residual parental right&rdquo;, within the meaning of this section, the authority to discipline defendant&rsquo;s child with respect to that child&rsquo;s conduct during the visitation period; thus, defendant was a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; for purposes of ยง703-309(1). 90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;physical harm&rdquo; encompassed in the definition of family violence in this section would not preclude a parent&rsquo;s right to use force to discipline a child as permitted by ยง703-309(1), and duty to discipline a child under ยง577-7(a). 88 H. 200 (App.), 965 P.2d 133.</p>
