L 2014, c 201, §21. Rules of Court Additional definitions, see HFCR rule 121. Case Notes Where defendant, a non-custodial parent, was acting within the defendant&amp;rsquo;s court-prescribed unsupervised visitation time, defendant retained, as a &amp;ldquo;residual parental right&amp;rdquo;, within the meaning of this section, the authority to discipline defendant&amp;rsquo;s child with respect to that child&amp;rsquo;s conduct during the visitation period; thus, defendant was a &amp;ldquo;parent&amp;rdquo; for purposes of §703-309(1). 90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399. The &amp;ldquo;physical harm&amp;rdquo; encompassed in the definition of family violence in this section would not preclude a parent&amp;rsquo;s right to use force to discipline a child as permitted by §703-309(1), and duty to discipline a child under §577-7(a). 88 H. 200 (App.), 965 P.2d 133.
