  "context": "[ยง571-86.5] Statewide juvenile justice interdepartmental cluster; local juvenile justice interdepartmental cluster; high-need youth services coordination. (a) There is established a statewide juvenile justice interdepartmental cluster to provide coordinated services, as defined in section 571-2, to certain children under the jurisdiction of the family court, and to provide an avenue for regular collaboration between the judiciary and the child and adolescent mental health division of the department of health. (b) The statewide cluster shall be composed of representatives from the major youth-serving agencies with statewide authority and responsibility. The statewide cluster shall include, in addition to the judiciary, designees from the department of education, the department of health, and the office of youth services. At the discretion of the representatives in the statewide cluster, community service providers may be included as regular members. The judiciary shall staff the statewide cluster and identify a place where development and management of coordinated services may be carried out on a regular basis. The statewide cluster may establish local juvenile justice interdepartmental clusters that shall have the ability to refer individual cases or issues to the statewide cluster for review and recommendation. The statewide cluster shall establish written policies and procedures for itself and any local juvenile justice interdepartmental clusters. &amp;copy; Family courts may recommend youth for consideration by the statewide cluster based on the results of a risk and needs assessment conducted pursuant to section 571-45 indicating that a youth is high-need and if the youth is actively involved with two or more youth-serving agencies. (d) Coordinated services for justice system-involved youth shall be identified and carried out using a coordinated service plan, developed during regular meetings of the statewide cluster. The coordinated service plan shall include: (1) An assessment of the individual needs of the youth; (2) Identification of services currently being provided; (3) Identification of the necessary coordinated services; (4) Identification of the public or private agencies that can provide the necessary coordinated services to the youth, and a description of how each coordinated service will be funded; (5) If any necessary coordinated service need cannot be met, a specific explanation as to why the service need could not be met, such as a lack of funding or unavailability of service, which shall be reported to the board of family court judges and the Hawaii juvenile justice state advisory council; and (6) Opportunities for participation from the youth&amp;rsquo;s legal parent, guardian, or custodian. (e) The statewide cluster shall annually report the number of cases referred to the cluster, the number of cases in which a coordinated service plan was established, and the outcome of the cases. This report shall be submitted to the board of family court judges and the Hawaii juvenile justice state advisory council.
