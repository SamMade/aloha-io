  "context": "[ยง571-52.7] Award of costs and reasonable attorneys&amp;rsquo; fees. Whenever a party files a motion seeking to enforce a child support order, the court may award the prevailing party the party&amp;rsquo;s costs and reasonable attorneys&amp;rsquo; fees incurred, except as this chapter otherwise provides. The award shall be made only when the prevailing party was represented by an attorney. [L 1994, c 247, ยง1] Case Notes Family court erred in limiting plaintiff ex-wife&amp;rsquo;s award of attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees to a lodestar amount with no consideration given to a contingent fee enhancement; this section is a fee-shifting statute designed to &amp;ldquo;attract competent counsel&amp;rdquo; and a contingent fee enhancement should have at least been considered by the family court. 97 H. 160 (App.), 34 P.3d 1059.
