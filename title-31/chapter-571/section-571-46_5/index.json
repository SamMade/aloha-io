(b) A parenting plan may include a general outline relating to parental responsibilities and parenting time. A general parenting plan may also allow the parents to develop a more detailed agreement on an informal basis. &amp;copy; A detailed parenting plan may include, but is not limited to, provisions relating to: (1) Residential schedule; (2) Holiday, birthday, and vacation planning; (3) Parental decision-making and responsibility; (4) Breastfeeding, if applicable; (5) Information sharing and access; (6) Relocation of parents; (7) Telephone access and other means of communication; (8) Right of first refusal procedures; (9) Transportation; and (10) Methods for changing or enforcing the parenting plan and for resolving disputes. (d) If the parties cannot agree on a parenting plan, the court may: (1) Order the parties to participate in alternative dispute resolution and in counseling with a person with professional experience in child custody or parenting issues, or with other appropriate education, unless there is a finding of family violence; and (2) Develop and file a detailed parenting plan when requested by either of the parties or parents. (e) The court or the parties may revise and amend the parenting plan from time to time. [L 2005, c 244, ยง1] "
