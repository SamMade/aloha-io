(a) Upon motion of the deploying parent and consistent with the best interest of the child, including safety considerations in cases involving a finding of domestic violence, the court may delegate the deploying parent&amp;rsquo;s parent-child contact rights, or a portion thereof, to a family member, whether biological or by adoption, or to a person to whom the deploying parent is married or with whom the deploying parent cohabitates; provided that the family member or person has an existing close and substantial relationship with the child. (b) Any delegated parent-child contact under this section shall not create separate rights of or standing to assert any rights to parent-child contact or any other contact for the family member or person. Any parent-child contact delegated under this section shall cease pursuant to court order, upon the return of the deployed parent, or upon the deployed parent&amp;rsquo;s death.
