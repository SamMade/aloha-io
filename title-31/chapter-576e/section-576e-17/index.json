  "context": "§576E-17 Medical support enforcement. (a) Where the responsible parent is ordered to provide medical insurance coverage for the dependent child, the standard notice for such medical support prescribed by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended by the agency, shall be issued. The agency shall forward a copy of the notice, by regular mail, by personal delivery, or by transmission through electronic means, to the responsible parent&amp;rsquo;s employer or union when the responsible parent fails to provide written proof to the agency, within thirty days of receipt of the order, that the insurance has been obtained, that application for insurance coverage has been made, or within two business days after the date of entry of a responsible parent in a Title IV-D case in the state directory of new hires, whichever shall first occur. (b) Upon receipt of the copy of the notice, or upon request of the responsible parent pursuant to the order, the employer or union shall transfer the notice to the appropriate plan providing health care coverage for which the child is eligible within twenty business days after the date of the notice or enroll the dependent child as a beneficiary in the group medical insurance plan and withhold any required premium from the responsible parent&amp;rsquo;s income. If more than one plan is offered by the employer or union, the child shall be enrolled in the plan in which the responsible parent is enrolled or the least costly plan otherwise available to the responsible parent that is comparable to the plan in which the responsible parent is enrolled. An employer who has received a copy of the notice shall inform the agency when the employment of the responsible parent is terminated. &amp;copy; A dependent child whom a responsible parent is required to cover as a beneficiary pursuant to this section is eligible for insurance coverage as a dependent of the responsible parent until the duty of support expires or until further court or administrative order. The insurance coverage shall not be terminated prior to the expiration of the duty of support or the entry of an order relieving the responsible parent of the duty to provide insurance coverage, unless it is determined by the agency that insurance coverage is being provided through appropriate alternative means. (d) The signature of the custodial parent of the insured dependent child is a valid authorization to the insurer for purposes of processing an insurance reimbursement payment to the provider of medical services. When an order for dependent insurance coverage is in effect and the responsible parent&amp;rsquo;s employment is terminated, or the insurance coverage is terminated, the insurer shall notify the agency within ten days of the termination date with notice of conversion privileges, if any. (e) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, when an order for insurance coverage is in effect, the responsible parent&amp;rsquo;s employer or union shall release to the agency, upon request, information on the dependent coverage available to the responsible parent, including the name of the insurer. The employer or union shall also provide any other information and perform all tasks as required by the notice issued pursuant to this section. (f) Any responsible parent who fails to comply with an order requiring the maintenance of insurance coverage for the dependent child shall be liable for any medical expenses incurred by the obligee or the State after the effective date of the order. (g) The agency may terminate the requirement for the responsible parent&amp;rsquo;s employer or union to enroll the dependent child as a beneficiary in the group medical insurance plan and withhold any required premium from the responsible parent&amp;rsquo;s income by sending a notice to the employer or union by regular mail, by personal delivery, or by transmission through electronic means. The notice shall be issued upon determination by the agency that the obligor no longer is required to provide medical insurance coverage or that such coverage is being provided by another employer.
