  "context": "[§577E-1] Findings and purpose. The legislature finds that, across the United States, there is a renewed understanding of the unique importance of fathers in the lives of their children, families, and communities. It is widely recognized that children are more likely to thrive with support, guidance, and nurturing from both parents. The absence of one parent from a child&amp;rsquo;s life can place that child at a greater risk of health, emotional, educational, and behavioral problems associated with the child&amp;rsquo;s development. However, many young men today are themselves fatherless, lack appropriate role models, and are in need of information and education regarding the appropriate roles and responsibilities of fathers. The legislature further finds that the role of fathers in the raising of children and in the health and well-being of families is often unintentionally overlooked in government contracts, programs, and services dealing with children&amp;rsquo;s health, welfare, and education. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for a statewide program to promote healthy family relationships between parents and children.
