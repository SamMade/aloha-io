  "context": "[ยง584-10] Pretrial proceedings. As soon as practicable after an action to declare the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship has been brought, an informal hearing shall be held. The public shall be barred from the hearing. A record of the proceeding or any portion thereof shall be kept if any party requests, or the court orders. Rules of evidence need not be observed. [L 1975, c 66, pt of ยง1] Rules of Court Pre-trial procedure, see HFCR rule 16. Case Notes In a paternity action, ยง584-13 and this section mandate that an informal, pre-trial hearing be held by the court to evaluate the likelihood of establishing at trial the alleged father as the natural father, to determine whether declaring paternity would be in the best interest of the child, and to recommend settlement to the parties; such a hearing is not required before a court may order genetic testing of the parties. 88 H. 159 (App.), 963 P.2d 1135.
