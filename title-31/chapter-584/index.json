The enactment of this chapter: (1) does not displace the Hawaii supreme court&amp;rsquo;s previous decision in Blackshear; (2) does not prevent a proper litigant in a paternity action from asserting defenses based upon res judicata and equitable estoppel; and, (3) a final judgment, including a divorce decree, can serve as the basis for such defenses. 99 H. 1, 52 P.3d 255. The term &amp;ldquo;may&amp;rdquo;, as set forth in §560:2-114(a), is permissive, and, for purposes of intestate succession, a purported heir may establish his or her parent-child relationship with the decedent by any means permitted by statute, including, but not limited to, this chapter. 103 H. 275, 81 P.3d 1190. This chapter did not implicate father&amp;rsquo;s fundamental privacy right to procreational autonomy, but rather father&amp;rsquo;s economic interest in not supporting his child, and although father had standing to raise an equal protection challenge to this chapter, that standing was based on a non-suspect classification, i.e., the biological relationship of fathers to their children; thus, because this chapter bears a rational relation to the public welfare, the statute survives rational basis review and father&amp;rsquo;s privacy and equal protection arguments failed. 109 H. 240, 125 P.3d 461.
