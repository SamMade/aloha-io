Case Notes Where defendant testified at defendant&amp;rsquo;s criminal trial that complainant was defendant&amp;rsquo;s niece and that they had formerly resided together at the home of defendant&amp;rsquo;s father, this testimony established that defendant and complainant met the definition of &amp;ldquo;family or household member&amp;rdquo; under this section; thus, family court had jurisdiction to issue the protection order under §586-5.5 and the protection order was valid. 112 H. 136 (App.), 144 P.3d 584 (2006).
