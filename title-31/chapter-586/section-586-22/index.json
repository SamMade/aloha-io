(a) A protective order issued by another state, tribe, or territory shall be considered valid if: (1) The issuing court or tribunal had jurisdiction over the parties and matter under the laws of the state, tribe, or territory; and (2) The respondent received notice and an opportunity to be heard before the foreign protective order was issued; provided that, in the case of an ex parte order, notice and opportunity to be heard were provided within a reasonable period of time, sufficient to protect the respondent&amp;rsquo;s right to due process. (b) Failure to provide reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard shall be an affirmative defense to any charge or process filed seeking enforcement of an out-of-state protective order.
