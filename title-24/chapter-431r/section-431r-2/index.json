(a) An otherwise qualified retail community pharmacy registered to do business in this State that requests to enter into a contractual retail pharmacy network agreement accepting the standard terms, conditions, formularies, or requirements relating to dispensing fees, payments, reimbursement amounts, or other pharmacy services shall be considered part of a pharmacy benefit manager&amp;rsquo;s retail pharmacy network for purposes of a beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s right to choose where to purchase covered prescription drugs under section 431R-3. (b) It shall be a violation of this section for a prescription drug benefit plan, health benefits plan under chapter 87A, or pharmacy benefit manager to refuse to accept an otherwise qualified retail community pharmacy as part of a pharmacy benefit manager&amp;rsquo;s retail pharmacy network. &amp;copy; A contractual retail pharmacy network agreement entered into under this section shall be renewed annually, unless agreed to by the parties. If a prescription drug benefit plan, health benefits plan under chapter 87A, or pharmacy benefit manager who has entered into a contractual retail pharmacy network agreement with a retail community pharmacy considers such retail community pharmacy no longer otherwise qualified, the prescription drug benefit plan, health benefits plan under chapter 87A, or pharmacy benefit manager may appeal the retail community pharmacy&amp;rsquo;s qualifications with the insurance commissioner. (d) The insurance commissioner shall determine the standards and requirements necessary for a retail community pharmacy to be deemed &amp;ldquo;otherwise qualified&amp;rdquo; for purposes of this section.
