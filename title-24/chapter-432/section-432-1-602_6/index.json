(a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, whenever a policy, contract, plan, or agreement provides coverage for the children of the insured, that coverage shall also extend to the date of birth of any newborn child to be adopted by the insured; provided that the insured gives written notice to the society of the insured&amp;rsquo;s intent to adopt the child prior to the child&amp;rsquo;s date of birth or within thirty days after the child&amp;rsquo;s birth or within the time period required for enrollment of a natural born child under the policy, contract, plan, or agreement of the insured, whichever period is longer; provided, however, if the adoption proceedings are not successful, the insured shall reimburse the society for any expenses paid for the child. Where notification has not been received by the society prior to the child&amp;rsquo;s birth or within the specified period following the child&amp;rsquo;s birth, insurance coverage shall be effective from the first day following the society&amp;rsquo;s receipt of legal notification of the insured&amp;rsquo;s ability to consent for treatment of the infant whom coverage is sought. (b) When the insured is a member of a health maintenance organization (HMO), coverage of an adopted newborn is effective: (1) From the date of birth of the adopted newborn when the newborn is treated from birth pursuant to a provider contract with the health maintenance organization, and written notice of enrollment in accord with the health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s usual enrollment process is provided within thirty days of the date the insured notifies the health maintenance organization of the insured&amp;rsquo;s intent to adopt the infant for whom coverage is sought; or (2) From the first day following receipt by the health maintenance organization of written notice of the insured&amp;rsquo;s ability to consent for treatment of the infant for whom coverage is sought and enrollment of the adopted newborn in accord with the health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s usual enrollment process if the newborn has been treated from birth by a provider not contracting or affiliated with the health maintenance organization.
