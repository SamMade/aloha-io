      <p><strong>PART V. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>[ยง431C-41] Prohibited practices.</strong> (a) It is unlawful for any person to:</p>

<p>(1) Enter into a life settlement contract if the person knows or reasonably should have known that the policy was obtained by means of a false, deceptive, or misleading application for such policy;</p>

<p>(2) Engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business if the person knows or reasonably should have known that the intent was to avoid the notice requirements of this chapter;</p>

<p>(3) Engage in any fraudulent act or practice in connection with any transaction relating to any life settlement contract involving an owner who is a resident of this State;</p>

<p>(4) Issue, solicit, market, or otherwise promote the purchase of a policy for the purpose of or with an emphasis on settling the policy;</p>

<p>(5) Enter into a premium finance agreement with any person or agency, or any person affiliated with the person or agency, pursuant to which the person shall receive any proceeds, fees, or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from the policy or owner of the policy or any other person with respect to the premium finance agreement or any life settlement contract or other transaction related to such policy that are in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, interest, and service charges related to policy premiums pursuant to the premium finance agreement or subsequent sale of such agreement; provided that any payments, charges, fees or other amounts in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, interest, and service charges related to policy premiums paid under the premium finance agreement shall be remitted to the original owner of the policy or to the owner&rsquo;s estate if the owner is not living at the time of the determination of the overpayment;</p>

<p>(6) With respect to any policy or life settlement contract and a broker, knowingly solicit an offer from, effectuate a life settlement contract with or make a sale to any provider, financing entity, or related provider trust that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such broker;</p>

<p>(7) With respect to any policy or life settlement contract and a provider, knowingly enter into a life settlement contract with an owner, if, in connection with such life settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a broker that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such provider or the financing entity or related provider trust that is involved in such life settlement contract;</p>

<p>(8) With respect to a provider, enter into a life settlement contract unless the life settlement contract promotional, advertising, and marketing materials, as may be prescribed by rule, have been filed with the commissioner. In no event shall any marketing materials expressly reference that the insurance is free for any period of time. The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause an owner to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a violation of this chapter;</p>

<p>(9) With respect to any life insurance producer, insurance company, broker, or provider, make any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy;</p>

<p>(10) Knowingly and intentionally interfere with the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or investigations of suspected or actual violations of this chapter; and</p>

<p>(11) With respect to a person in the business of life settlements, knowingly or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust to participate in the business of life settlements.</p>

<p>(b) A violation of this section shall be deemed a fraudulent life settlement act. [L 2012, c 256, pt of ยง1]</p>
