If the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner&amp;rsquo;s estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the provider; (6) The fact that proceeds will be sent to the owner within three business days after the provider has received the insurer or group administrator&amp;rsquo;s acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated in accordance with the terms of the life settlement contract; (7) The fact that entering into a life settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or certificate, to be forfeited by the owner and that assistance should be sought from a professional financial advisor; (8) The amount and method of calculating the compensation paid or to be paid to the broker, or any other person acting for the owner in connection with the transaction, wherein the term compensation includes anything of value paid or given; (9) The date by which the funds will be available to the owner and the transmitter of the funds; (10) The fact that the commissioner shall require delivery of a buyer&amp;rsquo;s guide or a similar consumer advisory package in the form prescribed by the commissioner to owners during the solicitation process; (11) The following language: &amp;ldquo;All medical, financial, or personal information solicited or obtained by a provider or broker about an insured, including the insured&amp;rsquo;s identity or the identity of family members, a spouse, or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to effect the life settlement contract between the owner and provider. If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every two years.&amp;rdquo;; (12) The fact that the commissioner shall require providers and brokers to print separate signed fraud warnings on their applications and on their life settlement contracts as follows: &amp;ldquo;Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or life settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison.&amp;rdquo;; (13) The fact that the owner may be contacted by either the provider or broker or its authorized representative for the purpose of determining the owner&amp;rsquo;s health status or to verify the owner&amp;rsquo;s address; (14) The affiliation, if any, between the provider and the issuer of the policy to be settled; (15) That a broker represents exclusively the owner, and not the insurer or the provider or any other person, and owes a fiduciary duty to the owner, including a duty to act according to the owner&amp;rsquo;s instructions and in the best interest of the owner; (16) The name, address, and telephone number of the provider; (17) The name, business address, and telephone number of the independent third party escrow agent, and the fact that the owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents; and (18) The fact that a change of ownership could in the future limit the insured&amp;rsquo;s ability to purchase future insurance on the insured&amp;rsquo;s life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one life.
