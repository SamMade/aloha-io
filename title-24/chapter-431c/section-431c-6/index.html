      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Reporting requirements and privacy</h2>
      <p><strong>[ยง431C-6] Reporting requirements and privacy.</strong> (a) For any policy settled within five years of policy issuance, each provider shall file with the commissioner on or before March 1 of each year an annual statement containing the information as the commissioner may prescribe by rule. In addition to any other requirements, the annual statement shall:</p>

<p>(1) Specify the total number, aggregate face amount, and life settlement proceeds of policies settled during the immediately preceding calendar year, together with a breakdown of the information by policy issue year; and</p>

<p>(2) Include the names of the insurance companies whose policies have been settled and the brokers who have settled said policies.</p>

<p>The information shall be limited to only those transactions where the insured is a resident of this State and shall not include individual transaction data regarding the business of life settlements or information that there is a reasonable basis to believe could be used to identify the owner or the insured.</p>

<p>Every provider that wilfully fails to file an annual statement as required in this section, or wilfully fails to reply within thirty days to a written inquiry by the commissioner in connection therewith, in addition to other penalties provided by this chapter, and upon due notice and opportunity to be heard, shall be subject to a penalty of up to $250 per day of delay, not to exceed $25,000 in the aggregate, for each such failure.</p>

<p>(b) Except as otherwise allowed or required by law, a provider, broker, insurance company, insurance producer, information bureau, rating agency or company, or any other person with actual knowledge of an insured&rsquo;s identity, shall not disclose the identity of an insured or information that there is a reasonable basis to believe could be used to identify the insured or the insured&rsquo;s financial or medical information to any other person unless the disclosure:</p>

<p>(1) Is necessary to effect a life settlement contract between the owner and a provider, and the owner and insured have provided prior written consent to the disclosure;</p>

<p>(2) Is necessary to effectuate the sale of life settlement contracts, or interests therein, as investments, so long as the sale is conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal securities law and the owner and the insured have both provided prior written consent to the disclosure;</p>

<p>(3) Is provided in response to an investigation or examination by the commissioner pursuant to the requirements of section 431C-17 or any other governmental officer or agency;</p>

<p>(4) Is a term or condition to the transfer of a policy by one provider to another provider, in which case the receiving provider shall be required to comply with the confidentiality requirements of this section;</p>

<p>(5) Is necessary to allow the provider or broker or their authorized representatives to make contacts for the purpose of determining health status. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;authorized representative&rdquo; shall not include any person who has or may have any financial interest in the life settlement contract other than a provider, licensed broker, financing entity, related provider trust, or special purpose entity. A provider or broker shall require its authorized representative to agree in writing to adhere to the privacy provisions of this section; or</p>

<p>(6) Is required to purchase stop loss coverage.</p>

<p>&copy; Non-public personal information solicited or obtained in connection with a proposed or actual life settlement contract shall be subject to the provisions applicable to financial institutions under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, P.L. 106-102, and all other applicable state and federal laws relating to confidentiality of non-public personal information.
