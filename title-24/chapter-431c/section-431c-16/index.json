(a) No cause of action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against the commissioner, the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s authorized representatives, or any examiner appointed by the commissioner for any statements made or conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this chapter. (b) No cause of action shall arise, nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of communicating or delivering information or data to the commissioner or the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s authorized representative or examiner pursuant to an examination made under this chapter, if the act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive. This subsection does not abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in subsection (a). &amp;copy; A person identified in subsection (a) or (b) shall be entitled to an award of attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander, or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of this chapter and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this section, a proceeding is &amp;ldquo;substantially justified&amp;rdquo; if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it was initiated. [L 2012, c 256, pt of ยง1] "
