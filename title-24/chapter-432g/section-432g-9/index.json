(a) Any carrier providing replacement coverage with respect to group dental benefits within a period of sixty days from the date of discontinuance of a prior dental insurer contract or policy providing such dental benefits shall immediately cover all enrollees who were validly covered under the previous dental insurer contract or policy at the date of discontinuance and who would otherwise be eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier&amp;rsquo;s contract, regardless of any provisions of the contract relating to active employment. (b) Except to the extent benefits for the condition would have been reduced or excluded under the prior carrier&amp;rsquo;s contract or policy, no provision in a succeeding carrier&amp;rsquo;s contract of replacement coverage which would operate to reduce or exclude benefits on the basis that the condition giving rise to a claim for benefits preexisted the effective date of the succeeding carrier&amp;rsquo;s contract shall be applied with respect to those enrollees validly covered under the prior carrier&amp;rsquo;s contract or policy on the date of discontinuance.
