  "context": "[ยง432G-7] Uncovered expenditures insolvency deposit. (a) If, at any time, uncovered expenditures exceed ten per cent of total dental care expenditures, a dental insurer shall place with the commissioner or with any organization or trustee acceptable to the commissioner through which a custodial or controlled account is maintained, an uncovered expenditures insolvency deposit consisting of cash or securities that are acceptable to the commissioner. Such deposit shall have, at all times, a fair market value in an amount of one-hundred-twenty per cent of the dental insurer&amp;rsquo;s outstanding liability for uncovered expenditures for enrollees in this State, including incurred but not reported claims, and shall be calculated as of the first day of the month and maintained for the remainder of the month. If a dental insurer is not otherwise required to file a quarterly report, it shall file a report within forty-five days of the end of the calendar quarter with information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with this section. (b) The deposit required under this section is in addition to the deposit required under section 432G-6 and is an asset of the dental insurer in the determination of net worth. All income from the deposits or trust accounts subject to this section shall be an asset of the dental insurer and may be withdrawn from the deposit or trust account quarterly with the approval of the commissioner. &amp;copy; A dental insurer that has made a deposit may withdraw that deposit or any part of the deposit if: (1) A substitute deposit of cash or securities of equal amount and value is made; (2) The fair market value exceeds the amount of the required deposit; or (3) The required deposit under subsection (a) is reduced or eliminated. Deposits, substitutions, or withdrawals may be made only with the prior written approval of the commissioner. (d) The deposit required under this section shall be held in trust and shall be used only as provided in this section. The commissioner may use the deposit of an insolvent dental insurer for administrative costs associated with administering the deposit and payment of claims of enrollees of this State for uncovered expenditures in this State. Claims for uncovered expenditures shall be paid on a pro rata basis based on assets available to pay such ultimate liability for incurred expenditures. Partial distribution may be made pending final distribution. Any amount of the deposit remaining shall be paid into the liquidation or receivership of the dental insurer. (e) The commissioner may prescribe the time, manner, and form for filing claims under subsection (d). (f) The commissioner may require dental insurers to file annual, quarterly, or more frequent reports as the commissioner deems necessary to demonstrate compliance with this section. The commissioner may require that the reports include liability for uncovered expenditures as well as an audit opinion. [L 2013, c 191, pt of ยง1] "
