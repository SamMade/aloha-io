<p>&ldquo;Uncovered expenditures&rdquo; means the costs to the dental insurer for dental care services that are the obligation of the dental insurer, for which an enrollee may also be liable in the event of the dental insurer&rsquo;s insolvency, and for which no alternative arrangements have been made that are acceptable to the commissioner. Uncovered expenditures include but are not limited to out-of-area services, referral services, and hospital services. Uncovered expenditures shall not include expenditures for services when a provider has agreed not to bill the enrollee even though the provider is not paid by the dental insurer, or for services that are guaranteed, insured, or assumed by a person or organization other than the dental insurer.
