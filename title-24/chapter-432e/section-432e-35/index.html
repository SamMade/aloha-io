      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Expedited external review</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง432E-35 Expedited external review.</strong> (a) Except as provided in subsection (i), an enrollee or the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative may request an expedited external review with the commissioner if the enrollee receives:</p>

<p>(1) An adverse determination that involves a medical condition of the enrollee for which the time frame for completion of an expedited internal appeal would seriously jeopardize the enrollee&rsquo;s life, health, or ability to gain maximum functioning or would subject the enrollee to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the adverse determination;</p>

<p>(2) A final adverse determination if the enrollee has a medical condition where the time frame for completion of a standard external review would seriously jeopardize the enrollee&rsquo;s ability to gain maximum functioning, or would subject the enrollee to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the adverse determination; or</p>

<p>(3) A final adverse determination if the final adverse determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the enrollee received emergency services; provided that the enrollee has not been discharged from a facility for health care services related to the emergency services.</p>

<p>(b) Upon receipt of a request for an expedited external review, the commissioner shall immediately send a copy of the request to the health carrier. Immediately upon receipt of the request, the health carrier shall determine whether the request meets the reviewability requirements set forth in subsection (a). The health carrier shall immediately notify the enrollee or the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative of its determination of the enrollee&rsquo;s eligibility for expedited external review.</p>

<p>Notice of ineligibility for expedited external review shall include a statement informing the enrollee and the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative that a health carrier&rsquo;s initial determination that an external review request that is ineligible for review may be appealed to the commissioner by submission of a request to the commissioner.</p>

<p>&copy; Upon receipt of a request for appeal pursuant to subsection (b), the commissioner shall review the request for expedited external review submitted pursuant to subsection (a) and, if eligible, shall refer the enrollee for external review. The commissioner&rsquo;s determination of eligibility for expedited external review shall be made in accordance with the terms of the enrollee&rsquo;s health benefit plan and all applicable provisions of this part. If an enrollee is not eligible for expedited external review, the commissioner shall immediately notify the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, and the health carrier of the reasons for ineligibility.</p>

<p>(d) If the commissioner determines that an enrollee is eligible for expedited external review even though the enrollee has not exhausted the health carrier&rsquo;s internal review process, the health carrier shall not be required to proceed with its internal review process. The health carrier may elect to proceed with its internal review process even though the request is determined by the commissioner to be eligible for expedited external review; provided that the internal review process shall not delay or terminate an expedited external review unless the health carrier decides to reverse its adverse determination and provide coverage or payment for the health care service that is the subject of the adverse determination. Immediately after making a decision to reverse its adverse determination, the health carrier shall notify the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s authorized representative, the independent review organization assigned pursuant to subsection (e), and the commissioner in writing of its decision. The assigned independent review organization shall terminate the expedited external review upon receipt of notice from the health carrier pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p>(e) Upon receipt of the notice pursuant to subsection (b) or a determination of the commissioner pursuant to subsection (d) that the enrollee meets the eligibility requirements for expedited external review, the commissioner shall immediately randomly assign an independent review organization to conduct the expedited external review from the list of approved independent review organizations qualified to conduct the external review, based on the nature of the health care service that is the subject of the adverse action and other factors determined by the commissioner including conflicts of interest pursuant to section 432E-43, compiled and maintained by the commissioner to conduct the external review and immediately notify the health carrier of the name of the assigned independent review organization.</p>

<p>(f) Upon receipt of the notice from the commissioner of the name of the independent review organization assigned to conduct the expedited external review, the health carrier or its designee utilization review organization shall provide or transmit all documents and information it considered in making the adverse action that is the subject of the expedited external review to the assigned independent review organization electronically or by telephone, facsimile, or any other available expeditious method.</p>

<p>(g) In addition to the documents and information provided or transmitted pursuant to subsection (f), the assigned independent review organization shall consider the following in reaching a decision:</p>

<p>(1) The enrollee&rsquo;s pertinent medical records;</p>

<p>(2) The attending health care professional&rsquo;s recommendation;</p>

<p>(3) Consulting reports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the health carrier, enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, or the enrollee&rsquo;s treating provider;</p>

<p>(4) The application of medical necessity criteria as defined in section 432E-1;</p>

<p>(5) The most appropriate practice guidelines, which shall include evidence-based standards, and may include any other practice guidelines developed by the federal government, national or professional medical societies, boards, and associations;</p>

<p>(6) Any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by the health carrier or its designee utilization review organization in making adverse determinations; and</p>

<p>(7) The opinion of the independent review organization&rsquo;s clinical reviewer or reviewers pertaining to the information enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) to the extent the information and documents are available and the clinical reviewer or reviewers consider appropriate.</p>

<p>In reaching a decision, the assigned independent review organization shall not be bound by any decisions or conclusions reached during the health carrier&rsquo;s utilization review or internal appeals process; provided that the independent review organization&rsquo;s decision shall not contradict the terms of the enrollee&rsquo;s health benefit plan or this part.</p>

<p>(h) As expeditiously as the enrollee&rsquo;s medical condition or circumstances requires, but in no event more than seventy-two hours after the date of receipt of the request for an expedited external review that meets the reviewability requirements set forth in subsection (a), the assigned independent review organization shall:</p>

<p>(1) Make a decision to uphold or reverse the adverse action; and</p>

<p>(2) Notify the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, the health carrier, and the commissioner of the decision.</p>

<p>If the notice provided pursuant to this subsection was not in writing, within forty-eight hours after the date of providing that notice, the assigned independent review organization shall provide written confirmation of the decision to the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, the health carrier, and the commissioner that includes the information provided in section 432E-37.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the notice of a decision reversing the adverse action, the health carrier shall immediately approve the coverage that was the subject of the adverse action.</p>

<p>(i) An expedited external review shall not be provided for retrospective adverse or final adverse determinations. [L 2011, c 230, pt of ยง2; am L 2012, c 34, ยง12]</p>
