      <p><strong>[</strong><strong>ยง432E-34] Standard external review.</strong> (a) An enrollee or the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative may file a request for an external review with the commissioner within one hundred thirty days of receipt of notice of an adverse action. Within three business days after the receipt of a request for external review pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall send a copy of the request to the health carrier.</p>

<p>(b) Within five business days following the date of receipt of the copy of the external review request from the commissioner pursuant to subsection (a), the health carrier shall determine whether:</p>

<p>(1) The individual is or was an enrollee in the health benefit plan at the time the health care service was requested or, in the case of a retrospective review, was an enrollee in the health benefit plan at the time the health care service was provided;</p>

<p>(2) The health care service that is the subject of the adverse determination or the final adverse determination would be a covered service under the enrollee&rsquo;s health benefit plan but for a determination by the health carrier that the health care service does not meet the health carrier&rsquo;s requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness;</p>

<p>(3) The enrollee has exhausted the health carrier&rsquo;s internal appeals process or the enrollee is not required to exhaust the health carrier&rsquo;s internal appeals process pursuant to section 432E-33(b); and</p>

<p>(4) The enrollee has provided all the information and forms required to process an external review, including a completed release form and disclosure form as required by section 432E-33(a).</p>

<p>&copy; Within three business days after a determination of an enrollee&rsquo;s eligibility for external review pursuant to subsection (b), the health carrier shall notify the commissioner, the enrollee, and the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative in writing as to whether the request is complete and whether the enrollee is eligible for external review.</p>

<p>If the request for external review submitted pursuant to this section is not complete, the health carrier shall inform the commissioner, the enrollee, and the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative in writing that the request is incomplete and shall specify the information or materials required to complete the request.</p>

<p>If the enrollee is not eligible for external review pursuant to subsection (b), the health carrier shall inform the commissioner, the enrollee, and the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative in writing that the enrollee is not eligible for external review and the reasons for ineligibility.</p>

<p>Notice of ineligibility for external review pursuant to this section shall include a statement informing the enrollee and the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative that a health carrier&rsquo;s initial determination that the external review request is ineligible for review may be appealed to the commissioner by submission of a request to the commissioner.</p>

<p>(d) Upon receipt of a request for appeal pursuant to subsection &copy;, the commissioner shall review the request for external review submitted by the enrollee pursuant to subsection (a), determine whether an enrollee is eligible for external review and, if eligible, shall refer the enrollee to external review. The commissioner&rsquo;s determination of eligibility for external review shall be made in accordance with the terms of the enrollee&rsquo;s health benefit plan and all applicable provisions of this part. If an enrollee is not eligible for external review, the commissioner shall notify the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, and the health carrier within three business days of the reason for ineligibility.</p>

<p>(e) When the commissioner receives notice pursuant to subsection &copy; or makes a determination pursuant to subsection (d) that an enrollee is eligible for external review, within three business days after receipt of the notice or determination of eligibility, the commissioner shall:</p>

<p>(1) Randomly assign an independent review organization from the list of approved independent review organizations qualified to conduct the external review, based on the nature of the health care service that is the subject of the adverse action and other factors determined by the commissioner including conflicts of interest pursuant to section 432E-43, compiled and maintained by the commissioner to conduct the external review and notify the health carrier of the name of the assigned independent review organization; and</p>

<p>(2) Notify the enrollee and the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, in writing, of the enrollee&rsquo;s eligibility and acceptance for external review.</p>

<p>(f) An enrollee or an enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative may submit additional information in writing to the assigned independent review organization for consideration in its external review. The independent review organization shall consider information submitted within five business days following the date of the enrollee&rsquo;s receipt of the notice provided pursuant to subsection (e). The independent review organization may accept and consider additional information submitted by an enrollee or an enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative after five business days.</p>

<p>(g) Within five business days after the date of receipt of notice pursuant to subsection (e), the health carrier or its designated utilization review organization shall provide to the assigned independent review organization all documents and information it considered in issuing the adverse action that is the subject of external review. Failure by the health carrier or its utilization review organization to provide the documents and information within five business days shall not delay the conduct of the external review; provided that the assigned independent review organization may terminate the external review and reverse the adverse action that is the subject of the external review. The independent review organization shall notify the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, the health carrier, and the commissioner within three business days of the termination of an external review and reversal of an adverse action pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p>(h) The assigned independent review organization shall, within one business day of receipt by the independent review organization, forward all information received from the enrollee pursuant to subsection (f) to the health carrier. Upon receipt of information forwarded to it pursuant to this subsection, a health carrier may reconsider the adverse action that is the subject of the external review; provided that reconsideration by the health carrier shall not delay or terminate an external review unless the health carrier reverses its adverse action and provides coverage or payment for the health care service that is the subject of the adverse action. The health carrier shall notify the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, the assigned independent review organization, and the commissioner in writing of its decision to reverse its adverse action within three business days of making its decision to reverse the adverse action and provide coverage. The assigned independent review organization shall terminate its external review upon receipt of notice pursuant to this subsection from the health carrier.</p>

<p>(i) In addition to the documents and information provided pursuant to subsections (f) and (g), the assigned independent review organization shall consider the following in reaching a decision:</p>

<p>(1) The enrollee&rsquo;s medical records;</p>

<p>(2) The attending health care professional&rsquo;s recommendation;</p>

<p>(3) Consulting reports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the health carrier, enrollee, enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representatives, or enrollee&rsquo;s treating provider;</p>

<p>(4) The application of medical necessity as defined in section 432E-1;</p>

<p>(5) The most appropriate practice guidelines, which shall include applicable evidence-based standards and may include any practice guidelines developed by the federal government or national or professional medical societies, boards, and associations;</p>

<p>(6) Any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by the health carrier or its designated utilization review organization; and</p>

<p>(7) The opinion of the independent review organization&rsquo;s clinical reviewer or reviewers pertaining to the information enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) to the extent the information or documents are available and the clinical reviewer or reviewers consider appropriate.</p>

<p>In reaching a decision, the assigned independent review organization shall not be bound by any decisions or conclusions reached during the health carrier&rsquo;s utilization review or internal appeals process; provided that the independent review organization&rsquo;s decision shall not contradict the terms of the enrollee&rsquo;s health benefit plan or this part.</p>

<p>(j) Within forty-five days after it receives a request for an external review pursuant to subsection (e), the assigned independent review organization shall notify the enrollee, the enrollee&rsquo;s appointed representative, the health carrier, and the commissioner of its decision to uphold or reverse the adverse action that is the subject of the internal review. The independent review organization shall include in the notice of its decision:</p>

<p>(1) A general description of the reason for the request for external review;</p>

<p>(2) The date the independent review organization received the assignment from the commissioner to conduct the external review;</p>

<p>(3) The date the external review was conducted;</p>

<p>(4) The date the decision was issued; and</p>

<p>(5) The basis for the independent review organization&rsquo;s decision, including its reasoning, rationale, and the supporting evidence or documentation, including evidence-based standards, that the independent review organization considered in reaching its decision.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of a notice of a decision reversing the adverse action, the health carrier shall immediately approve the coverage that was the subject of the adverse action. [L 2011, c 230, pt of ยง2]</p>
