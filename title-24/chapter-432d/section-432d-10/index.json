  "context": "[ยง432D-10] Enrollment period. (a) In the event of an insolvency of a health maintenance organization, upon order of the commissioner, all other carriers offered as alternatives to the insolvent health maintenance organization at a group&amp;rsquo;s last regular enrollment period shall offer to those members of the group who enrolled in the insolvent health maintenance organization a thirty-day enrollment period commencing upon the date of insolvency. Each carrier shall offer the enrollees of the insolvent health maintenance organization the same coverages and rates that it had offered to the enrollees of the group at its last regular enrollment period. (b) If no other carrier had been offered to some groups enrolled in the insolvent health maintenance organization, or if the commissioner determines that the other health benefit plans lack sufficient health care delivery resources to assure that health care services will be available and accessible to all of the group&amp;rsquo;s enrollees of the insolvent health maintenance organization, then the commissioner shall equitably allocate the insolvent health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s group contracts for such groups among all health maintenance organizations that operate within a portion of the insolvent health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s service area, taking into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health maintenance organization. Each health maintenance organization to which a group is so allocated shall offer the group the health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s existing coverage that is most similar to each group&amp;rsquo;s coverage with the insolvent health maintenance organization at rates determined in accordance with the successor health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s existing rating methodology. &amp;copy; The commissioner also shall allocate equitably the insolvent health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s nongroup enrollees who are unable to obtain other coverage among all health maintenance organizations which operate within a portion of the insolvent health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s service area, taking into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health maintenance organization. Each health maintenance organization to which nongroup enrollees are allocated shall offer such nongroup enrollees the health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s existing coverage for individual or conversion coverage as determined by the enrollee&amp;rsquo;s type of coverage in the insolvent health maintenance organization at rates determined in accordance with the successor health maintenance organization&amp;rsquo;s existing rating methodology. Successor health maintenance organizations that do not offer direct nongroup enrollment may aggregate all of the allocated nongroup enrollees into one group for rating and coverage purposes.
