[L 1995, c 179, pt of §1; am L 2014, c 186, §15] Case Notes Reading this section in pari materia with §432D-8, the Hawaii legislature did not intend to eliminate the enforcement of an implied contract between a participating provider and a health maintenance organization. To hold that only written contracts are valid would render the &amp;ldquo;implied contract&amp;rdquo; phrase in this section [definition of &amp;ldquo;participating provider&amp;rdquo;] meaningless because §432-8 would bar the enforcement of such an implied contract. 948 F. Supp. 2d 1131 (2013). Properly licensed HMOs, like plaintiff, were authorized pursuant to this section to &amp;ldquo;provide or arrange&amp;rdquo;, at their option, for the closed panel health care services required under the managed care plan program; accident and health insurers were authorized under §431:10A-205(b) to arrange for medical services for members using a defined network of providers, i.e., particular &amp;ldquo;hospitals or persons&amp;rdquo;; thus, article 431:10A and chapter 432D authorized both accident and health insurers and HMOs, as risk-bearing entities, to provide the closed panel product required by the managed care plan contracts. 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).
