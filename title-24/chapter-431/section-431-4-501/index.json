(a) A domestic insurer may reorganize, merge or consolidate with another insurer subject to the provisions of this part, and subject to the following conditions: (1) The plan of reorganization, merger, or consolidation shall be submitted to and be approved by the commissioner in advance of the reorganization, merger, or consolidation. (2) The commissioner shall not approve any such plan unless the commissioner finds that it is fair, equitable, and consistent with law. If the commissioner fails to approve the plan, the commissioner shall state the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s reasons for such failure in the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s decision. (3) No director, officer, member, or subscriber of any such insurer, except as is expressly provided by the plan of reorganization, merger, or consolidation, shall receive any fee, commission, other compensation or valuable consideration whatsoever, for in any manner aiding, promoting, or assisting in the reorganization, merger, or consolidation. (4) Any reorganization, merger, or consolidation as to an incorporated domestic insurer shall in other respects be governed by the general laws of this State relating to business corporations. Except, that as to domestic mutual insurers, approval by two-thirds of its members who vote thereon pursuant to the notice and procedure as was approved by the commissioner shall constitute approval of the reorganization, merger, or consolidation as respects the insurer&amp;rsquo;s members. (b) Reinsurance of all or substantially all of the insurance in force of a domestic insurer by another insurer shall be deemed a consolidation for the purposes of this part.
