(a) An outline of coverage shall be delivered to a prospective applicant for long-term care insurance at the time of initial solicitation through means that prominently direct the attention of the recipient to the document and its purpose. The commissioner shall prescribe a standard format, including style, arrangement, and overall appearance, and the content of an outline of coverage. In the case of producer solicitations, a producer shall deliver the outline of coverage prior to the presentation of an application or enrollment form. In the case of direct response solicitation, the outline of coverage shall be presented in conjunction with any application or enrollment form. In the case of a policy issued to a group defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of &amp;ldquo;group long-term care insurance&amp;rdquo; in section 431:10H-104, an outline of coverage shall not be required to be delivered; provided that the information described in subsection (b) is contained in other materials relating to enrollment. Upon request, these other materials shall be made available to the commissioner. (b) The outline of coverage shall include: (1) A description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy; (2) A statement of the principal exclusions, reductions, and limitations contained in the policy; (3) A statement of the terms under which the policy or certificate, or both, may be continued in force or discontinued, including any reservation in the policy of a right to change premium. Continuation or conversion provisions of group coverage shall be specifically described; (4) A statement that the outline of coverage is a summary only, not a contract of insurance, and that the policy or group master policy contains governing contractual provisions; (5) A description of the terms under which the policy or certificate may be returned and premium refunded; (6) A brief description of the relationship of costs of care and benefits; and (7) A statement that discloses to the policyholder or certificate holder whether the policy is intended to be a federally tax-qualified long-term care insurance contract under section 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
