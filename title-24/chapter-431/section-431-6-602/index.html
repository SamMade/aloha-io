      <p><strong>[§431:6-602]</strong> <strong>Securities lending, repurchase, reverse repurchase, and dollar roll; investment pools.</strong> (a) For purposes of this section, &ldquo;business entity&rdquo; includes a sole proprietorship, corporation, limited liability company, association, partnership, joint stock company, joint venture, mutual fund, trust, joint tenancy, or other similar form of business organization, whether organized for-profit or not-for-profit.</p>

<p>(b) This section is applicable to investment pools under section 431:6-601.</p>

<p>&copy; An insurer may enter into securities lending, repurchase, reverse repurchase, and dollar roll transactions with business entities, subject to the requirements of this section.</p>

<p>(d) The board of directors shall adopt a written plan which shall include at least the following:</p>

<p>(1) A description of how cash received will be invested or used for general corporate purposes of the insurer;</p>

<p>(2) Operational procedures to manage interest rate risk, counterparty default risk, the conditions under which proceeds from reverse repurchase transactions may be used in the ordinary course of business and the use of acceptable collateral in a manner that reflects the liquidity needs of the transaction; and</p>

<p>(3) The extent to which the insurer may engage in these transactions.</p>

<p>(e) The insurer shall enter into a written agreement for all transactions authorized in this section other than dollar roll transactions. The written agreement shall require that each transaction terminate no more than one year from its inception or upon the earlier demand of the insurer. The agreement shall be with the business entity counterparty, but for securities lending transactions, the agreement may be with an agent acting on behalf of the insurer, if the agent is a qualified business entity, and if the agreement:</p>

<p>(1) Requires the agent to enter into separate agreements with each counterparty that are consistent with the requirements of this section; and</p>

<p>(2) Prohibits securities lending transactions under the agreement with the agent or its affiliates.</p>

<p>(f) Cash received in a transaction under this section shall be invested in accordance with section 431:6-601, and in a manner that recognizes the liquidity needs of the transaction or used by the insurer for its general corporate purposes. For so long as the transaction remains outstanding, the insurer, its agent, or custodian shall maintain acceptable collateral received in a transaction under this section, either physically or through the book entry systems of the Federal Reserve, Depository Trust Company, Participants Trust Company, or other securities depositories approved by the commissioner.</p>

<p>(g) In a securities lending transaction, the insurer shall receive acceptable collateral having a market value as of the transaction date, at least equal to one hundred two per cent of the market value of the securities loaned by the insurer in the transaction as of that date. If at any time the market value of the acceptable collateral is less than the market value of the loaned securities, the business entity counterparty shall be obligated to deliver additional acceptable collateral, the market value of which, together with the market value of all acceptable collateral then held in connection with the transaction, at least equals one hundred two per cent of the market value of the loaned securities.</p>

<p>(h) In a reverse repurchase transaction, other than a dollar roll transaction, the insurer shall receive acceptable collateral having a market value as of the transaction date at least equal to ninety-five per cent of the market value of the securities transferred by the insurer in the transaction as of that date. If at any time the market value of the acceptable collateral is less than ninety-five per cent of the market value of the securities so transferred, the business entity counterparty shall be obligated to deliver additional acceptable collateral, the market value of which, together with the market value of all acceptable collateral then held in connection with the transaction, at least equals ninety-five per cent of the market value of the transferred securities.</p>

<p>(i) In a dollar roll transaction, the insurer shall receive cash in the amount at least equal to the market value of the securities transferred by the insurer in the transaction as of the transaction date.</p>

<p>(j) In a repurchase transaction, the insurer shall receive as acceptable collateral transferred securities having a market value at least equal to one hundred two per cent of the purchase price paid by the insurer for the securities. If at any time the market value of the acceptable collateral is less than one hundred per cent of the purchase price paid by the insurer, the business entity counterparty shall be obligated to provide additional acceptable collateral, the market value of which, together with the market value of all acceptable collateral then held in connection with the transaction, at least equals one hundred two per cent of the purchase price. Securities acquired by an insurer in a repurchase transaction shall not be sold in a reverse repurchase transaction, loaned in a securities lending transaction, or otherwise pledged.
