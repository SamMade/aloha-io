(a) Each individual and group accident and health or sickness insurance policy, contract, plan, or agreement issued or renewed in this State after December 31, 2015, shall provide to the policyholder and individuals under twenty-six years of age covered under the policy, contract, plan, or agreement, coverage of medically necessary orthodontic services for the treatment of orofacial anomalies resulting from birth defects or birth defect syndromes. Coverage required by this section shall be paid for by medical insurance. (b) Every insurer shall provide written notice to its policyholders regarding the coverage required by this section. The notice shall be in writing and prominently positioned in any literature or correspondence sent to policyholders and shall be transmitted to policyholders within calendar year 2016 when annual information is made available to members or in any other mailing to members, but in no case later than December 31, 2016. &amp;copy; Orthodontic services for treatment of orofacial anomalies provided under this section shall be subject to a maximum benefit of $5,500 per treatment phase, but shall not be subject to limits on the number of visits to an orthodontist. After December 31, 2016, the insurance commissioner, on an annual basis, shall adjust the maximum benefit for inflation using the medical care component of the United States Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers. The commissioner shall publish the adjusted maximum benefit annually no later than April 1 of each calendar year, which shall apply during the following calendar year to accident and health or sickness insurance policies, contracts, plans, or agreements subject to this section. Payments made by an insurer on behalf of a covered individual for any care, treatment, intervention, or service other than orthodontic services, shall not be applied toward any maximum benefit established under this subsection. (d) Coverage under this section may be subject to copayment, deductible, and coinsurance provisions of an accident and health or sickness insurance policy, contract, plan, or agreement that are no less favorable than the copayment, deductible, and coinsurance provisions for other medical services covered by the policy, contract, plan, or agreement. (e) This section shall not be construed as limiting benefits that are otherwise available to an individual under an accident and health or sickness insurance policy, contract, plan, or agreement. (f) Coverage for treatment under this section shall not be denied on the basis that the treatment is habilitative or non-restorative in nature. (g) This section shall not apply to limited benefit health insurance as provided pursuant to section 431:10A-102.5. (h) As used in this section, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: &amp;ldquo;Orofacial anomalies&amp;rdquo; means cleft lip or cleft palate and other birth defects of the mouth and face affecting functions such as eating, chewing, speech, and respiration. &amp;ldquo;Orthodontic services&amp;rdquo; mean direct or consultative services provided by a licensed dentist with a certification in orthodontics by the American Board of Orthodontics. &amp;ldquo;Treatment of orofacial anomalies&amp;rdquo; includes the care prescribed, provided, or ordered for an individual diagnosed with an orofacial anomaly by a craniofacial team that includes a licensed dentist, orthodontist, oral surgeon, and physician, and is coordinated between specialists and providers.
