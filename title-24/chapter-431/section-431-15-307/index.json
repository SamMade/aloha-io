  "context": "ยง431:15-307 Liquidation orders. (a) An order to liquidate the business of a domestic insurer shall appoint the commissioner and the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s successors in office liquidator, and shall direct the liquidator forthwith to take possession of the assets of the insurer and to administer them under the general supervision of the court. The liquidator shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action and all of the books and records of the insurer ordered liquidated, wherever located, as of the entry of the final order of liquidation. The filing or recording of the order with the clerk of the circuit court of the first judicial circuit and at the bureau of conveyances shall impart the same notice as evidence of title. (b) Upon issuance of the order, the rights and liabilities of any such insurer and of its creditors, policyholders, shareholders, members and all other persons interested in its estate shall become fixed as of the date of entry of the order of liquidation, except as provided in section 431:15-308 and section 431:15-327. &amp;copy; An order to liquidate the business of an alien insurer domiciled in this State shall be in the same terms and have the same legal effect as an order to liquidate a domestic insurer, except that the assets and the business in the United States shall be the only assets and business included therein. (d) At the time of petitioning for an order of liquidation, or at any time thereafter, the commissioner, after making appropriate findings of an insurer&amp;rsquo;s insolvency, may petition the court for a judicial declaration of such insolvency. After providing such notice and hearing as it deems proper the court may make the declaration. (e) Any order issued under this section shall require accounting to the court by the liquidator. Accountings shall be at such intervals as the court specifies in its order. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2] "
