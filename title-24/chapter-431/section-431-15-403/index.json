(a) The domiciliary liquidator of an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state shall, except as to special deposits and security on secured claims under section 431:15-404&amp;copy;, be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the assets, property, contracts, and rights of action, producers&amp;rsquo; balances, and all of the books, accounts, and other records of the insurer located in this State. The date of vesting shall be the date of the filing of the petition, if that date is specified by the domiciliary law for the vesting of property in the domiciliary state. Otherwise, the date of vesting shall be the date of entry of the order directing possession to be taken. The domiciliary liquidator shall have the immediate right to recover balances due from producers and to obtain possession of the books, accounts, and other records of the insurer located in this State. The domiciliary liquidator shall also have the right to recover all other assets of the insurer located in this State, subject to section 431:15-404. (b) If a domiciliary liquidator is appointed for an insurer not domiciled in a reciprocal state, the commissioner of this State shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action, and all of the books, accounts and other records of the insurer located in this State, at the same time that the domiciliary liquidator is vested with title in the domicile. The commissioner of this State may petition for a conservation or liquidation order under section 431:15-401 or section 431:15-402, or for an ancillary receivership under section 431:15-404, or after approval by the circuit court of the first judicial circuit, may transfer title to the domiciliary liquidator, as the interests of justice and the equitable distribution of the assets require. &amp;copy; Claimants residing in this State may file claims with the liquidator or ancillary receiver, if any, in this State or with the domiciliary liquidator, if the domiciliary law permits. The claims must be filed on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims in the domiciliary liquidation proceedings. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 2002, c 155, §88] "
