If the commissioner finds that because of noncompliance by a controlling producer or any other person with this article or any applicable rule or order, the controlled insurer or any policyholder thereof has suffered any loss or damage, the commissioner may maintain a civil action or intervene in an action brought by or on behalf of the controlled insurer or policyholder for recovery of compensatory damages for the benefit of the controlled insurer or policyholder, or other appropriate relief.</p>

<p>(b) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of the controlled insurer has been entered pursuant to article 15 and the receiver appointed under that order believes that the controlling producer or any other person has not complied with this article, or any applicable rule or order, and the controlled insurer suffered any loss or damage from the noncompliance, the receiver may maintain a civil action for recovery of damages or other appropriate sanctions for the benefit of the controlled insurer.</p>

<p>&copy; Nothing contained in this section shall affect the right of the commissioner to impose any other penalties provided for in the insurance code.</p>

<p>(d) Nothing contained in this section is intended to or shall in any manner alter or affect the rights of policyholders, claimants, creditors, or other third parties. [L 1992, c 176, pt of §1]ondition, ownership, and management of the insurer and any person controlling the insurer;</p>

<p>(F) Reinsurance agreements;</p>

<p>(4) Any pledge of the insurer&rsquo;s stock, including stock of any subsidiary or controlling affiliate, for a loan made to any member of the insurance holding company system;</p>

<p>(5) If requested by the commissioner, financial statements of an insurance holding company system. Financial statements may include but are not limited to annual audited financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. An insurer required to file financial statements pursuant to this paragraph may satisfy the request by providing the commissioner with the most recently filed financial statements of the parent corporation that have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;</p>

<p>(6) Other matters concerning transactions between registered insurers and any affiliates as may be included from time to time in any registration forms adopted or approved by the commissioner; and</p>

<p>&copy; All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items in the current registration statement representing changes from the prior registration statement.</p>

<p>(d) No information need be disclosed on the registration statement filed pursuant to subsection (b) if the information is not material for the purposes of this section. Unless the commissioner by rule or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments, or guarantees involving one-half of one per cent or less of an insurer&rsquo;s admitted assets as of the December 31 next preceding shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section.</p>

<p>(f) Any person within an insurance holding company system subject to registration shall be required to provide complete and accurate information to an insurer, where the information is reasonably necessary to enable the insurer to comply with the provisions of this article.</p>

<p>(h) The commissioner may require or allow two or more affiliated insurers subject to registration to file a consolidated registration statement.</p>

In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted. The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the commissioner, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.</p>

<p>(m) The failure to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration statement, or enterprise risk filing required by this section within the time specified for the filing shall be a violation of this section.
