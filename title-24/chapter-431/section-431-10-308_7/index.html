      <p><strong>§431:10C-308.7</strong> <strong>Client-patient referrals, health care provider practices prohibited.</strong> (a) An attorney or a law firm of which the attorney is a member or by which the attorney is employed may not establish a pattern of consistently referring clients to the same health care provider as a result of any accidental harm which is subject to benefits under this article, and a health care provider may not establish a pattern of consistently referring patients to the same attorney or law firm as a result of any accidental harm which is subject to benefits under this article. Any attorney, or any attorney from the law firm of which the attorney is a member or by which the attorney is employed, and that health care provider engaged in such pattern shall be presumed to be in violation of this section.</p>

<p>As used in this section, &ldquo;law firm&rdquo; means any sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other entity having members or employees who engage in the practice of law in this State.</p>

<p>(d) The health care provider shall make the disclosure required by this section in advance and in writing, and shall obtain the signature of the patient and retain the disclosure form for a period of two years. The health care provider shall include in the disclosure a statement indicating that the patient is free to choose a different health care provider.</p>

<p>(e) The regulated industries complaints office, department of commerce and consumer affairs, shall refer reports of any attorney in violation of this section to the appropriate professional licensing or regulatory body, for investigation and disciplinary action, including the suspension or revocation of the attorney&rsquo;s license to practice.</p>

<p>(f) The regulated industries complaints office, department of commerce and consumer affairs, may initiate investigations and disciplinary action to enforce this section regarding any reports of health care provider referrals of persons eligible for benefits under this article that may violate this section.</p>
