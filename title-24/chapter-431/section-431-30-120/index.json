  "context": "[ยง431:30-120] Default. (a) If the commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (&amp;ldquo;defaulting state&amp;rdquo;) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or duly adopted rules or operating procedures, then, after notice and hearing as set forth in the bylaws, all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact on such defaulting party shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the commission. The grounds for default include but are not limited to failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in commission rules. The commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the defaulting state&amp;rsquo;s suspension pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. (b) Product approvals by the commission or product self-certifications, or any other advertisement in connection with the product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the defaulting state in the same manner as if the defaulting state had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to section 431:30-119(a). &amp;copy; Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires a reenactment of the compact by the state seeking reinstatement.
