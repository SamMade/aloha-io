In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium shall be those as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if a filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in the state where the insured resided prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(2) &ldquo;Misstatement of Age: If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the insured&rsquo;s correct age&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(3) Other insurance in this insurer shall be in one of the following forms:</p>

<p>(A) &ldquo;Other Insurance in This Insurer: If an accident and health or sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured concurrently in force, making the aggregate indemnity for (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $ (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for the excess shall be returned to the insured or to the insured&rsquo;s estate&rdquo;; or</p>

<p>(4) Insurance with other insurers. Either or both of the following forms shall be used:</p>

For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the like amount of other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of the other coverage&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(ii) &ldquo;Insurance with Other Insurers: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for benefits under this policy shall be for the proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for a loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all the indemnities for the loss, and for the return of the portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the indemnities thus determined&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(B) If the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(i) is included in a policy that also contains the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii), there shall be added to the caption of the subparagraph (A)(i) provision the phrase, &ldquo;expense incurred benefits&rdquo;;</p>

<p>&copy; The insurer may, at its option, include in the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(i) a definition of other valid coverage, approved as to form by the commissioner, which shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this State or any other state or territory of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner. In the absence of a definition the term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payment insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations, union welfare plans, or employer or employee benefit organizations.  For the purpose of applying the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(i) with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for an insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers&rsquo; compensation or employers&rsquo; liability statute), whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be other valid coverage of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(i), no third party liability coverage shall be included as other valid coverage;</p>

<p>(D) If the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) is included in a policy that also contains the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(i), there shall be added to the caption of the subparagraph (A)(ii) provision the phrase, &ldquo;other benefits&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(E) The insurer may, at its option, include in the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) a definition of other valid coverage, approved as to form by the commissioner, which shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this State or any other state or territory of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner. In the absence of a definition the term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for an insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute including any workers&rsquo; compensation or employers&rsquo; liability statute, whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be other valid coverage of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii), no third party liability coverage shall be included as other valid coverage;</p>

<p>(5) (A) &ldquo;Relation of Earnings to Insurance: If the total monthly amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, exceeds the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or the insured&rsquo;s average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is greater, the insurer shall be liable only for the proportionate amount of benefits under this policy as the amount of the monthly earnings or average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all coverage upon the insured at the time disability commences and for the return of the part of the premiums paid during the two preceding years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all coverage upon the insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in the coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(B) The policy provision in subparagraph (A) may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force, subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums until at least age fifty or, in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue; and</p>

<p>(6) &ldquo;Unpaid Premium: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted from the claim&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(7) &ldquo;Cancellation: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to the insured&rsquo;s last address as shown by the records of the insurer. The notice shall state when, not less than five days thereafter, the cancellation shall be effective. After the policy has been continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt or on a later date specified in the notice. In the event of cancellation, the insurer shall return promptly the unearned portion of any premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of cancellation&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(8) &ldquo;Conformity with State Statutes: Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on the effective date is hereby amended to conform to the minimum requirements of the applicable statutes&rdquo;;</p>
