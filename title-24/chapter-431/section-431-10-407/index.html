      <p><strong>§431:10D-407 Delivery of illustration and record retention.</strong> (a) If a basic illustration is used by an insurance producer or other authorized representative of the insurer in the sale of a life insurance policy and the policy is applied for as illustrated, a copy of that illustration, signed in accordance with this part, shall be submitted to the insurer at the time of policy application. A copy also shall be provided to the applicant.</p>

<p>(b) If the policy is issued other than as applied for, a revised basic illustration conforming to the policy as issued shall be sent with the policy. The revised illustration shall:</p>

<p>(1) Conform to the requirements of this part;</p>

<p>(2) Be labeled &ldquo;Revised Illustration&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(3) Be signed and dated by the applicant or policy owner and producer or other authorized representative of the insurer no later than the time the policy is delivered.</p>

<p>A copy of the revised illustration shall be provided to the insurer and the policy owner.</p>

<p>&copy; If the policy is identified as one to be marketed with an illustration, and no illustration is used by an insurance producer or other authorized representative in the sale of a life insurance policy or if the policy is applied for other than as illustrated, the producer or representative shall certify to that effect in writing on a form provided by the insurer; provided that:</p>

<p>(1) On the same form the applicant shall acknowledge that no illustration conforming to the policy applied for was provided and shall further acknowledge an understanding that an illustration conforming to the policy as issued will be provided no later than at the time of policy delivery. This form shall be submitted to the insurer at the time of policy application;</p>

<p>(2) If the policy is issued, a basic illustration conforming to the policy as issued shall be sent with the policy and signed no later than the time the policy is delivered; and</p>

<p>(3) A copy shall be provided to the insurer and the policy owner.</p>

<p>(d) If the basic illustration or revised illustration is sent to the applicant or policy owner by mail from the insurer, it shall include instructions for the applicant or policy owner to sign the duplicate copy of the numeric summary page of the illustration for the policy issued and return the signed copy to the insurer. The insurer&rsquo;s obligation under this subsection shall be satisfied if it can demonstrate that it has made a diligent effort to secure a signed copy of the numeric summary page. The requirement to make a diligent effort shall be deemed satisfied if the insurer includes in the mailing a self-addressed postage prepaid envelope with instructions for the return of the signed numeric summary page.</p>

<p>(e) A copy of the basic illustration and a revised illustration, if any, signed as applicable, along with any certification that either no illustration was used or that the policy was applied for other than as illustrated, shall be retained by the insurer until three years after the policy is no longer in force. A copy need not be retained if no policy is issued. <a href="C">L 2000, c 252, pt of §2; am L 2004, c 122, §55</a> or the exclusive use of a vehicle for domestic-household-familial purposes; and</p>

<p>(E) All other motor vehicles, not classified under subparagraph (A), (B), &copy;, or (D), owned by licensed drivers who are unable to obtain motor vehicle insurance policies and optional additional insurance through ordinary methods;</p>

<p>(2) The plan shall provide personal injury protection benefits and bodily injury and property damage policies for all classes of persons, motor vehicles, and motor vehicle uses, at the premiums specified under subpart C, at the option of the owners, for the following classes, which the commissioner, by rules, shall further define and regulate:</p>

<p>(A) All licensed drivers, or unlicensed permanently disabled individuals unable to operate their motor vehicles, who are receiving public assistance benefits consisting of direct cash payments, or who received public assistance benefits in the form of medical services prior to July 1, 1994, and are still receiving the benefits, through the department of human services, or benefits from the Supplemental Security Income program under the Social Security Administration; provided that the licensed drivers, or unlicensed permanently disabled individuals unable to operate their motor vehicles, are the sole registered owners of the motor vehicles to be insured; provided further that not more than one vehicle per public assistance unit shall be insured under this part, unless extra vehicles are approved by the department of human services as being necessary for medical or employment purposes; provided further that the motor vehicle to be insured shall be used strictly for personal purposes, and not for commercial purposes;</p>

<p>(B) Any licensed physically handicapped driver, including drivers with any auditory limitation; and</p>

<p>&copy; Any licensed driver who is a minor under foster care and whose parents are unable to pay for the minor&rsquo;s motor vehicle insurance as provided in [section 346-17.3].</p>

<p>Each category of driver/owner under subparagraphs (A), (B), and &copy; may secure motor vehicle insurance coverage through the plan at the individual&rsquo;s option; provided any previous motor vehicle insurance policy has expired or has been canceled. Any person becoming eligible for plan coverage under subparagraph (A) shall first exhaust all paid coverage under any motor vehicle insurance policy then in force before becoming eligible for plan coverage.</p>

<p>Any person eligible or becoming eligible under rules adopted by the commissioner under subparagraph (B) or &copy; may at any time elect coverage under the plan and terminate any prior private insurer&rsquo;s coverage.</p>

<p>A certificate shall be issued by the department of human services indicating that the person is a bona fide public assistance recipient as defined in subparagraph (A). The certificate shall be deemed a policy for the purposes of this chapter upon the issuance of a valid motor vehicle insurance identification card pursuant to section 431:10C-107; and</p>

<p>(3) Under the joint underwriting plan, the required motor vehicle policy coverages as provided in section 431:10C-301 shall be offered by every insurer to each eligible applicant assigned by the bureau. In addition, uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverages shall be offered in conformance with section 431:10C-301, and optional additional coverages shall be offered in conformance with section 431:10C-302, for each class except the class defined in paragraph (2)(A), as the commissioner, by rules, shall provide.</p>

<p>&copy; The commissioner may further refine the definitions of the classifications provided for in subsection (b).
