<p>(ii) The refusal, cancellation, or limitation is required by law or regulatory mandate;</p>

<p>(D) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between individuals or risks of the same class and of essentially the same hazards by refusing to issue, refusing to renew, canceling, or limiting the amount of insurance coverage on a residential property risk, or the personal property contained therein, because of the age of the residential property, unless:</p>

<p>(i) The refusal, cancellation, or limitation is for a business purpose which is not a mere pretext for unfair discrimination; or</p>

<p>(ii) The refusal, cancellation, or limitation is required by law or regulatory mandate;</p>

<p>(E) Refusing to insure, refusing to continue to insure, or limiting the amount of coverage available to an individual because of the sex or marital status of the individual; however, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an insurer from taking marital status into account for the purpose of defining persons eligible for dependent benefits;</p>

<p>(F) Terminating or modifying coverage, or refusing to issue or renew any property or casualty policy or contract of insurance solely because the applicant or insured or any employee of either is mentally or physically impaired; provided that this subparagraph shall not apply to accident and health or sickness insurance sold by a casualty insurer; provided further that this subparagraph shall not be interpreted to modify any other provision of law relating to the termination, modification, issuance, or renewal of any insurance policy or contract;</p>

<p>(8) Rebates. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law:</p>

<p>(A) Knowingly permitting or offering to make or making any contract of insurance, or agreement as to the contract other than as plainly expressed in the contract, or paying or allowing, or giving or offering to pay, allow, or give, directly or indirectly, as inducement to the insurance, any rebate of premiums payable on the contract, or any special favor or advantage in the dividends or other benefits, or any valuable consideration or inducement not specified in the contract; or</p>

<p>(B) Giving, selling, or purchasing, or offering to give, sell, or purchase as inducement to the insurance or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds, or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation, association, or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or anything of value not specified in the contract;</p>

<p>(9) Nothing in paragraph (7) or (8) shall be construed as including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the following practices:</p>

<p>(A) In the case of any life insurance policy or annuity contract, paying bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance; provided that any bonus or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to policyholders and in the best interests of the insurer and its policyholders;</p>

<p>(B) In the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the insurer in an amount which fairly represents the saving in collection expense;</p>

<p>(D) In the case of any contract of insurance, the distribution of savings, earnings, or surplus equitably among a class of policyholders, all in accordance with this article;</p>

<p>(10) Refusing to provide or limiting coverage available to an individual because the individual may have a third-party claim for recovery of damages; provided that:</p>

<p>(A) Where damages are recovered by judgment or settlement of a third-party claim, reimbursement of past benefits paid shall be allowed pursuant to section 663-10;</p>

<p>(B) This paragraph shall not apply to entities licensed under chapter 386 or 431:10C; and</p>

<p>&copy; For entities licensed under chapter 432 or 432D:</p>

<p>(i) It shall not be a violation of this section to refuse to provide or limit coverage available to an individual because the entity determines that the individual reasonably appears to have coverage available under chapter 386 or 431:10C; and</p>

<p>(ii) Payment of claims to an individual who may have a third-party claim for recovery of damages may be conditioned upon the individual first signing and submitting to the entity documents to secure the lien and reimbursement rights of the entity and providing information reasonably related to the entity&rsquo;s investigation of its liability for coverage.</p>

<p>Any individual who knows or reasonably should know that the individual may have a third-party claim for recovery of damages and who fails to provide timely notice of the potential claim to the entity, shall be deemed to have waived the prohibition of this paragraph against refusal or limitation of coverage. &ldquo;Third-party claim&rdquo; for purposes of this paragraph means any tort claim for monetary recovery or damages that the individual has against any person, entity, or insurer, other than the entity licensed under chapter 432 or 432D;</p>

<p>(11) Unfair claim settlement practices. Committing or performing with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice any of the following:</p>

<p>(ii) Any other persons, including the commissioner; or</p>

<p>(iii) The insurer of a person involved in an incident in which the insurer&rsquo;s policyholder is also involved.</p>

<p>(D) Refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information;</p>

<p>(E) Failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed;</p>

<p>(F) Failing to offer payment within thirty calendar days of affirmation of liability, if the amount of the claim has been determined and is not in dispute;</p>

<p>(G) Failing to provide the insured, or when applicable the insured&rsquo;s beneficiary, with a reasonable written explanation for any delay, on every claim remaining unresolved for thirty calendar days from the date it was reported;</p>

<p>(H) Not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear;</p>

<p>(I) Compelling insureds to institute litigation to recover amounts due under an insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in actions brought by the insureds;</p>

<p>(J) Attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed the person was entitled by reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or made part of an application;</p>

<p>(K) Attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application which was altered without notice, knowledge, or consent of the insured;</p>

<p>(L) Making claims payments to insureds or beneficiaries not accompanied by a statement setting forth the coverage under which the payments are being made;</p>

<p>(O) Failing to promptly settle claims, where liability has become reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage to influence settlements under other portions of the insurance policy coverage;</p>

<p>(P) Failing to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial of a claim or for the offer of a compromise settlement; and</p>

<p>(Q) Indicating to the insured on any payment draft, check, or in any accompanying letter that the payment is &ldquo;final&rdquo; or is &ldquo;a release&rdquo; of any claim if additional benefits relating to the claim are probable under coverages afforded by the policy; unless the policy limit has been paid or there is a bona fide dispute over either the coverage or the amount payable under the policy;</p>

<p>(12) Failure to maintain complaint handling procedures. Failure of any insurer to maintain a complete record of all the complaints which it has received since the date of its last examination under section 431:2-302. This record shall indicate the total number of complaints, their classification by line of insurance, the nature of each complaint, the disposition of these complaints, and the time it took to process each complaint. For purposes of this section, &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; means any written communication primarily expressing a grievance;</p>

<p>(13) Misrepresentation in insurance applications. Making false or fraudulent statements or representations on or relative to an application for an insurance policy, for the purpose of obtaining a fee, commission, money, or other benefit from any insurer, producer, or individual; and</p>

<p>(14) Failure to obtain information. Failure of any insurance producer, or an insurer where no producer is involved, to comply with section 431:10D-623(a), (b), or &copy; by making reasonable efforts to obtain information about a consumer before making a recommendation to the consumer to purchase or exchange an annuity.</p>

<p>(b) The commissioner shall by certified mail notify the insurer&rsquo;s agent, as designated pursuant to section 431:2-205, of each complaint filed with the commissioner under this section.</p>

<p>&copy; Three or more written complaints received by the commissioner within any twelve-month period charging separate violations of this section shall constitute a rebuttable presumption of a general business practice.</p>

<p>(d) Evidence as to numbers and types of complaints to the commissioner against an insurer, and the commissioner&rsquo;s complaint experience with other insurers writing similar lines of insurance, shall be admissible in an administrative or judicial proceeding brought under this section. No insurer shall be deemed in violation of this section solely by reason of the numbers and types of such complaints except if the presumption under subsection &copy; is not rebutted.</p>

<p>(e) If it is found, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, that an insurer has violated this section, each instance of noncompliance may be treated as a separate violation of this section for the purposes of section 431:2-203.</p>

<p>(f) An insurer or licensee shall issue a written response with reasonable promptness, in no case more than fifteen working days, to any written inquiry made by the commissioner regarding a claim, consumer complaint, or sales or marketing practice. The response shall be more than an acknowledgment that the commissioner&rsquo;s communication has been received, and shall adequately address the concerns stated in the communication. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 1988, c 330, §2; am L 1989, c 396, §1; am L 1997, c 83, §4; am L 2000, c 29, §1; am L 2002, c 155, §81 and c 228, §1; am L 2003, c 212, §104; am L 2007, c 257, §3; am L 2008, c 227, §§2, 5; am L 2009, c 11, §22; am L 2010, c 116, §1(24); am L 2014, c 45, §11]</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Violations of the unfair settlement provision, subsection (a), may be used as evidence to indicate bad faith in accordance with the guidelines of Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Ins. Co. 27 F. Supp. 2d 1211.</p>

<p>An insurer that does not respond promptly to a party&rsquo;s settlement demand and does not negotiate settlement in good faith may violate subsection (a)(10). 73 H. 412, 835 P.2d 627.</p>

<p>Plaintiff may not maintain a private cause of action for an alleged violation of this section. 28 F. Supp. 2d 588.</p>

<p>Mentioned: 795 F. Supp. 1036; 255 F. Supp. 2d 1149.</p>

<p>Evidence regarding workers&rsquo; compensation insurer&rsquo;s failure to specifically address questions posed in a letter from claimant&rsquo;s counsel was insufficient to show that insurer failed to respond to communications &ldquo;with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice&rdquo; under subsection (a)(11)(B); insurer&rsquo;s failure thus did not violate this section or establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding claimant&rsquo;s allegation that insurer breached its duty to negotiate in good faith. 112 H. 195 (App.), 145 P.3d 738 (2006).</p>
