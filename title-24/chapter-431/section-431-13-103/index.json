Penn America Ins. Co. 27 F. Supp. 2d 1211. An insurer that does not respond promptly to a party&amp;rsquo;s settlement demand and does not negotiate settlement in good faith may violate subsection (a)(10). 73 H. 412, 835 P.2d 627. Plaintiff may not maintain a private cause of action for an alleged violation of this section. 28 F. Supp. 2d 588. Mentioned: 795 F. Supp. 1036; 255 F. Supp. 2d 1149. Evidence regarding workers&amp;rsquo; compensation insurer&amp;rsquo;s failure to specifically address questions posed in a letter from claimant&amp;rsquo;s counsel was insufficient to show that insurer failed to respond to communications &amp;ldquo;with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice&amp;rdquo; under subsection (a)(11)(B); insurer&amp;rsquo;s failure thus did not violate this section or establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding claimant&amp;rsquo;s allegation that insurer breached its duty to negotiate in good faith. 112 H. 195 (App.), 145 P.3d 738 (2006).
