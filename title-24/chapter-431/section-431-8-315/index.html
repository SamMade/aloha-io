      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Tax on surplus lines</h2>
      <p><strong>§431:8-315 Tax on surplus lines.</strong> (a) On or before March 15, 2011, each surplus lines broker shall pay to the director of finance, through the commissioner, a premium tax on surplus lines insurance transacted by the broker during 2010. On or before September 15, 2011, each surplus lines broker shall pay to the director of finance, through the commissioner, a premium tax on surplus lines insurance transacted by the broker after December 31, 2010, and before July 1, 2011. After June 30, 2011, within forty-five days after the end of each calendar quarter, each surplus lines broker shall pay to the director of finance, through the commissioner, a premium tax on surplus lines insurance transacted by the broker during the calendar quarter for insurance for which this State is the home state of the insured. The tax rate shall be in the amount of 4.68 per cent of gross premiums, less return premiums, on surplus lines insurance allocated to this State. The tax rate and fees of other states shall be applied to the gross premiums, less return premiums, allocated to those states.</p>

<p>As used in this subsection, &ldquo;gross premiums&rdquo; means the amount of the policy or coverage premium charged by the insurer in consideration for the insurance contract. Any charges for policy, survey, inspection, service, or similar fees or other charges added by the broker shall not be considered part of gross premiums.</p>

<p>(b) The commissioner shall collect the taxes and fees on independently procured surplus lines insurance and from surplus lines licensees and disburse to the other states the funds earned by each state; provided that the other state has a reciprocal allocation and disbursement procedure for the benefit of this State. To the extent that other states, where portions of the properties, risks, or exposures reside, have failed to establish a reciprocal allocation and disbursement procedure with this State, the net premium tax collected shall be retained by this State.</p>

<p>&copy; If a surplus lines policy covers risks or exposures only partially resident in this State, the tax payable shall be computed upon the proportion of the premium which is properly allocable to the risks or exposures located in this State. The taxes and fees payable to this State on policies that cover risks and exposures only partially resident in this State shall be remitted on the quarterly schedule established by subsection (a) to the home state of the insured for disbursement to this State.</p>

<p>(d) The tax on any portion of the premium unearned at the termination of the insurance contract shall be returned to the policyholder.</p>

<p>(e) The commissioner may:</p>

<p>(1) Enter into a cooperative agreement, reciprocal agreement, or compact with other states to facilitate and provide for the collection, allocation, and disbursement of premium taxes attributable to the placement of surplus lines insurance;</p>

<p>(2) Provide for uniform methods of allocation and reporting among surplus lines insurance risk classifications;</p>

<p>(3) Conform to the requirements of the federal Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010;</p>

<p>(4) Share information among states relating to surplus lines insurance premium taxes; and</p>

<p>(5) Utilize a method adopted in cooperation with other states to allocate risk and compute the tax due on the portion of premium attributable to each risk classification and to each state where properties, risks, or exposures are located.</p>

<p>The commissioner shall assess the insured for the cost of the cooperative agreement, reciprocal agreement, or compact to collect and distribute the premium taxes. Upon application of the insured, the commissioner shall refund the insured for excess payments of taxes received by the State that are the result of the statewide tax rate. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 2003, c 212, §48; am L 2006, c 154, §10; am L 2011, c 68, §13]</p>

<p>Revision Note</p>

<p>The paragraph defining &ldquo;gross premiums&rdquo; was moved from subsection (b) to subsection (a) pursuant to §23G-15.</p>
