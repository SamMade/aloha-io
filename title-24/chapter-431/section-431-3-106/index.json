  "context": "[ยง431:3D-106] Exemption. (a) An insurer shall be exempt from the requirements of this article if: (1) The insurer&amp;rsquo;s annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program, is less than $500,000,000; and (2) The insurance group of which the insurer is a member has an annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program, less than $1,000,000,000. (b) If an insurer qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(1), but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(2), then the own risk and solvency assessment summary report required pursuant to section 431:3D-105 shall include every insurer within the insurance group. This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one own risk and solvency assessment summary report for any combination of insurers; provided that any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group. &amp;copy; If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(1), but the insurance group of which it is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(2), then the only own risk and solvency assessment summary report required pursuant to section 431:3D-105 shall be the report applicable to that insurer. (d) An insurer that does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a) may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this article based upon unique circumstances. (1) In deciding whether to grant the insurer&amp;rsquo;s request for waiver, the commissioner may consider: (A) The type and volume of business written; (B) The ownership and organizational structure; and &amp;copy; Any other factor the commissioner considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member. (2) If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one state, the commissioner shall coordinate with the lead state commissioner and other domiciliary commissioners in considering whether to grant the insurer&amp;rsquo;s request for a waiver. (e) Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section: (1) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an own risk and solvency assessment, and file an own risk and solvency assessment summary report based upon unique circumstances including but not limited to the type and volume of business written, the ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests, and international supervisor requests. (2) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an own risk and solvency assessment, and file an own risk and solvency assessment summary report if the insurer: (A) Has risk-based capital for company action level event as set forth in section 431:3-403; (B) Meets one or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition as defined in section 431:15-103.5; or &amp;copy; Otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the commissioner. (f) If an insurer that qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subsection (a) subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to changes in premium, as reflected in the insurer&amp;rsquo;s most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer shall have one year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of this article.
