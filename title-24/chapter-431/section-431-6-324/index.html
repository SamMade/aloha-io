      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Subsidiaries</h2>
      <p><strong>§431:6-324 Subsidiaries.</strong> (a) Any domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may organize or acquire one or more subsidiaries subject to the limitations of this section.</p>

<p>(b) In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities permitted under all other sections of this article, a domestic insurer also may do one or more of the following:</p>

<p>(1) Invest, in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts that do not exceed the lesser of ten per cent of the insurer&rsquo;s assets or fifty per cent of the insurer&rsquo;s surplus as regards policyholders. However, after the investments, the insurer&rsquo;s surplus as regards policyholders shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer&rsquo;s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of the investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, and there shall be included:</p>

<p>(A) Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary, whether represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities; and</p>

<p>(B) All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus, of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation;</p>

<p>(2) If the insurer&rsquo;s total liabilities, as calculated for National Association of Insurance Commissioners&rsquo; annual statement purposes, are less than ten per cent of assets, invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries. However, after the investment the insurer&rsquo;s surplus as regards policyholders, considering the investment as if it were a disallowed asset, shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer&rsquo;s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs;</p>

<p>(3) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries; provided that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that the investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in paragraph (1) or in this article applicable to the insurer. For the purpose of this subsection, the total investment of the insurer shall include:</p>

<p>(A) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and</p>

<p>(B) The insurer&rsquo;s proportionate share of any investment of an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary&rsquo;s investment by the percentage of the insurer&rsquo;s ownership of the subsidiary;</p>

<p>(4) With the approval of the commissioner, invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries; provided that after the investment, the insurer&rsquo;s surplus as regards policyholders shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer&rsquo;s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs; or</p>

<p>(5) Invest any amount in the common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of any subsidiary exclusively engaged in holding title to, or holding title to and managing or developing real or personal property, if after considering as a disallowed asset so much of the investment as is represented by subsidiary assets, which if held directly by the insurer would be considered as a disallowed asset, the insurer&rsquo;s surplus as regards policyholders shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer&rsquo;s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.</p>

<p>&copy; Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to subsection (b) shall not be subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this article applicable to the investment of insurers.</p>

<p>(d) Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) meets the applicable requirements is to be determined immediately after the investment is made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the date they were made.</p>

<p>(e) If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment therein made pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further times as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment has been made, the investment has met the requirements for investment under any other section of this article, and the insurer has notified the commissioner thereof.</p>

<p>(f) In addition to the above subsection, any insurer acquiring or disposing of any subsidiary, must also comply with article 11 of this code. [L 1987, c 349, §6; am L 1993, c 205, §10; am L 2004, c 122, §22]</p>
