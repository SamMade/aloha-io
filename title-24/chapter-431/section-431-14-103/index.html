<p>(e) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the company shall be excluded from the surplus requirements of domestic mutual insurers from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2007.

Standards for the issuance of certificates shall be included in rules adopted by the department of labor and industrial relations pursuant to chapter 91.</p>
