(a) A domestic reciprocal insurer, upon affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the subscribers who vote upon such merger pursuant to such notice as may be approved by the commissioner and with approval of the commissioner of the terms therefor, may merge with another reciprocal insurer or be converted to a stock or mutual insurer. (b) Every new reciprocal insurer formed by merger shall assume and succeed to all of the obligations and liabilities of the respective merging reciprocal insurers and shall be held liable to pay and discharge all such debts and liabilities and perform such obligations in the same manner as if they had been incurred or contracted by it, but the subscribers of the predecessor reciprocal insurers shall continue subject to all the liabilities, claims, and demands which shall then exist, or which may thereafter accrue against them, or any of them, by reason of any liabilities and obligations incurred by them, or on their behalf as the subscribers before the date of merger. &amp;copy; Such a stock or mutual insurer shall be subject to the same capital requirements and shall have the same rights as a like domestic insurer transacting like classes of insurance. (d) The commissioner shall not approve: (1) Any plan for a merger or conversion which is inequitable to subscribers, or (2) Any plan for a conversion to a stock insurer which does not give each subscriber preferential right to acquire stock of the proposed insurer proportionate to the subscriber&amp;rsquo;s interest in the reciprocal insurer, as determined in accordance with section 431:4-424, and a reasonable length of time within which to exercise the right.
