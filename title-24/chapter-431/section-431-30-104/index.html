The actions of the commission as provided in this section shall have the force and effect of law and shall be binding on the compacting states to the extent and in the manner provided in the compact;</p>

<p>(5) Exercise its rulemaking authority and designate products and advertisements that may be subject to a self-certification process without the need for prior approval by the commission;</p>

<p>(7) Bring and prosecute legal proceedings or actions in its name as the commission; provided that the standing of any state insurance department to sue or be sued under applicable law shall not be affected;</p>

<p>(13) Accept any and all appropriate donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, and receive, use, and dispose of the same; provided that at all times the commission shall strive to avoid any appearance of impropriety;</p>

<p>(17) Enforce compliance by compacting states with rules, uniform standards, operating procedures, and bylaws;</p>

<p>(18) Provide for dispute resolution among compacting states;</p>

<p>(19) Advise compacting states on issues relating to insurers domiciled or doing business in noncompacting jurisdictions, consistent with the purposes of this compact;</p>

<p>(20) Provide advice and training to those personnel in state insurance departments responsible for product review, and be a resource for state insurance departments;</p>

<p>(21) Establish a budget and make expenditures;</p>

<p>(22) Borrow money;</p>

<p>(23) Appoint committees, including advisory committees comprised of members, state insurance regulators, state legislators or their representatives, insurance industry and consumer representatives, and such other interested persons as may be designated in the bylaws;</p>
