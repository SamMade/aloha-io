(2) In applying the percentages specified in paragraph (1)&amp;copy; and (D), no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of the amount of insurance or level amount equivalent. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined. (3) In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent level amount for the purpose of this subsection shall be deemed to be the level amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the inception of the insurance as the benefits under the policy. (4) The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to: (A) The adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for the term insurance benefits are payable, by (B) The adjusted premiums for the term insurance. The foregoing amounts in subparagraphs (A) and (B) being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs (1) and (3), except that, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(B), &amp;copy;, and (D), the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in paragraph (1)(B) shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in subparagraph (A). (5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (6) and (7), all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table; provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to any age not more than three years younger than the actual age of the insured and the calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half per cent a year, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty per cent of the rates of mortality according to the applicable table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on any other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner. (6) This paragraph shall not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8). In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits; provided that the rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent a year, except that: (A) A rate of interest not exceeding four per cent a year may be used for policies issued after June 1, 1976, and prior to June 1, 1979; (B) A rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent a year may be used for policies issued on or after June 1, 1979; and &amp;copy; For any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy, a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent a year may be used. For any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner. After June 1, 1959, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1966. After the filing of such notice, upon the specified date (which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for that company), this paragraph shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by the company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for the company shall be January 1, 1966. (7) This paragraph shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8). In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits; provided that the rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent a year, except that: (A) A rate of interest not exceeding four per cent a year may be used for policies issued on or after June 1, 1976, and prior to June 1, 1979; (B) A rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent a year may be used for policies issued on or after June 1, 1979; and &amp;copy; For any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent a year may be used. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner. After May 8, 1965, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1968. After the filing of the notice, upon the specified date (which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for that company), this paragraph shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by the company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for the company shall be January 1, 1968. (8) (A) This paragraph shall apply to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph. Except as provided in subparagraph (G), the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be a uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of: (i) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (ii) One per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and (iii) One hundred twenty-five per cent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter defined. In applying the percentage specified in clause (iii), no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this paragraph shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined. (B) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due. &amp;copy; In the case of policies that cause, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or that provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums, other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefit or premiums, the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums, and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change. (D) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (G), the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all the future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of the sum of: (i) The then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and (ii) The additional expense allowance, if any, over the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy. (E) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of: (i) One per cent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and (ii) One hundred twenty-five per cent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium. (F) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing the value defined in clause (i) by the value defined in clause (ii): (i) The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the charge times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the charges on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred, plus the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and (ii) The present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of charge on which a premium falls due. (G) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis that provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis that provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for the substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis. (H) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall: for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of either the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or, at the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors; for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this paragraph for policies issued in that calendar year; provided that: (i) At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this paragraph, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year; (ii) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, regardless of subsection (b), shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any; (iii) A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values; (iv) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance; (v) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables; (vi) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rule by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the commissioner approves by rule any commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual; and (vii) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rule by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the commissioner approves by rule any commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual. (I) As used in this paragraph, &amp;ldquo;nonforfeiture interest rate&amp;rdquo; means: (i) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five per cent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearer one quarter of one per cent; provided that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than four per cent; and (ii) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be as provided by the valuation manual. (J) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form that involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form. (K) After the effective date of this paragraph, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for the company. If a company makes no election, the operative date of this paragraph for the company shall be January 1, 1989. (L) In the case of any plan of life insurance that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance that is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in this subsection and subsections (b) to (d), then: (i) The commissioner shall be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections (b) to (d) and this subsection; (ii) The commissioner shall be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds; and (iii) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan shall not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, as determined by rules adopted by the commissioner. (f) Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in subsections &amp;copy;, (d), and (e) may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding subsection &amp;copy; to the contrary, additional benefits payable: (1) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means; (2) In the event of total and permanent disability; (3) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; (4) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply; (5) As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if the term insurance expires before the child&amp;rsquo;s age is twenty-six, is uniform in amount after the child&amp;rsquo;s age is one, and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; and (6) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. (g) This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1985. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount that does not differ by more than two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified, and the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the company under the policy. The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on the anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits that would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums that would have fallen due on and after the anniversary. The effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection &amp;copy; or (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection &amp;copy; or (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection. The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) or subsection (e)(8), whichever is applicable. Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, the percentage: (1) Shall be the same for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of: (A) The fifth policy anniversary; and (B) The first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and (2) Shall be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in paragraph (1) may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years. No basic cash value may be less than the value that would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection (e)(8), were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy&amp;rsquo;s compliance with this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy. Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections (b), &amp;copy;, (d), (e)(8), and (f). The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed in subsection (f)(1) to (6) shall conform with the principles of this subsection. (h) This section shall not apply to any of the following: (1) Reinsurance; (2) Group insurance; (3) Pure endowment; (4) Annuity or reversionary annuity contract; (5) Term policy uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy; (6) Term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsection (e), is less than the adjusted premium so calculated, on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy; (7) Policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year calculated as specified in subsections &amp;copy;, (d), and (e), exceeds two and one-half per cent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the policy year; and (8) Policy that shall be delivered outside this State through a producer or other representative of the company issuing the policy. For purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life. (i) After January 1, 1956, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this section after a specified date within six months from January 1, 1956. After the filing of the notice, then upon the specified date (which shall be the operative date for the company), this section shall become operative with respect to the policies thereafter issued by the company.
