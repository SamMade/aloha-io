There shall be no exception to the requirements of this subsection, unless the commissioner, pursuant to an insurer&amp;rsquo;s petition, shall find that the use of the rates required herein by an insurer will be inadequate to the extent that such rates jeopardize the solvency of the insurer required to use such rates.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, all rates for commercial liability insurance shall comply with the provisions of the casualty rating law contained in chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes. Any insurer which contends that the rate provided for in subsection (b) or &amp;copy; is inadequate shall state in its filing the rate it contends is appropriate and shall state with specificity the factors or data which it contends should be considered in order to produce such appropriate rate. The insurer shall be permitted to use all of the generally accepted actuarial techniques in making any filing pursuant to this subsection. It shall be the insurer&amp;rsquo;s or rating organization&amp;rsquo;s burden to actuarially justify any rate increase from the reduced rates provided for in subsection (b) or &amp;copy;.

(4) In the event a filing is disapproved in whole or in part, a petition and demand for a contested case hearing may be filed in accordance with chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The insurer or rating organization shall have the burden of proving that the disapproval is not justified. While the action of the commissioner in disapproving the rate filing is being challenged, the aggrieved insurer shall be entitled to charge the rates established as of September 30, 1986 or the filed rates, whichever is lower. (5) With respect to any approval or disapproval by the commissioner regarding any rate filing focusing upon the October 1, 1988, reduction, the aggrieved insurer shall be entitled to charge the rates established as of September 30, 1988, while the action of the commissioner is being challenged and contested. (6) Upon final disposition, pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, or by a court of competent jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner&amp;rsquo;s approval or disapproval of the rates, the insurance commissioner shall immediately determine and order that the insurer make the appropriate rebates of premiums to policyholders or allow the insurer to exact a surcharge on premiums.
