(a) Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any insurer or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof has committed or is about to commit a violation of this article or of any rule or order issued by the commissioner hereunder, the commissioner may apply to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit for an order enjoining the insurer or the director, officer, employee, or agent thereof from violating or continuing to violate this article or any rule or order, and for other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer&amp;rsquo;s policyholders, creditors, and shareholders or the public may require. (b) No security which is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or which is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule or order issued by the commissioner hereunder may be voted at any shareholders&amp;rsquo; meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though the securities were not issued and outstanding. No action taken at any such meeting shall be invalidated by the voting of the securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this State have so ordered. If an insurer or the commissioner has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule or order issued by the commissioner hereunder the insurer or the commissioner may apply to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit to enjoin any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition made in contravention of section 431:11-104 or any rule or order issued by the commissioner thereunder to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of the security already cast at any meeting of shareholders and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer&amp;rsquo;s policyholders, creditors, and shareholders or the public may require. &amp;copy; In any case where a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of this article or any rule or order issued by the commissioner hereunder, the circuit court of the first judicial circuit may, on such notice as the court deems appropriate, upon the application of the insurer or the commissioner seize or sequester any voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by the person, and issue an order with respect thereto as may be appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this article. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this article, the sites of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers shall be deemed to be in this State.
