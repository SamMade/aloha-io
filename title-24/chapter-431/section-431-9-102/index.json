(d)(1) The commissioner may issue a reinsurance intermediary license to any person, firm, association, or corporation that has complied with the requirements of this article. Any such license issued to a firm or association shall authorize all the members of that firm or association and any designated employees to act as reinsurance intermediaries under the license, and all those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements thereto. Any such license issued to a corporation shall authorize all of the officers, and any designated employees and directors thereof to act as reinsurance intermediaries on behalf of the corporation, and all those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements thereto.

Upon written request therefor, the commissioner shall furnish a summary of the basis for refusal to issue a license, which document shall be privileged and not subject to disclosure pursuant to chapter 92F.
