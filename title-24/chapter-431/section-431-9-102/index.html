      <p><strong>§431:9C-102 Licensure.</strong> (a) No person, firm, association, or corporation shall act as a managing general agent, with respect to risks located in this State for an insurer licensed in this State, unless licensed as a producer in this State.</p>

<p>(b) No person, firm, association, or corporation shall act as a managing general agent representing an insurer domiciled in this State with respect to risks located outside this State unless licensed as a producer in this State. [L 2002, c 155, pt of §2; am L 2003, c 212, §70; am L 2006, c 189, §7; am L 2010, c 116, §1(10)]s State shall maintain a license as a reinsurance intermediary-manager in this State. A reinsurance intermediary-manager license shall be required to act as a reinsurance intermediary-manager in this State for a nondomestic reinsurer.</p>

<p>&copy; The commissioner may require a reinsurance intermediary-manager subject to subsection (b) to:</p>

<p>(1) File a bond from an insurance company licensed to do business within the State or with an insurance company approved by the commissioner in an amount equal to $500,000 or ten per cent of the annual reinsurance premiums managed by the reinsurance intermediary-manager, whichever is greater, except that the bond amount under this paragraph shall not exceed $10,000,000, for the protection of the reinsurer;</p>

<p>(2) Maintain an errors and omissions policy, with an insurance company licensed to do business within the State or with an insurance company approved by the commissioner, in an amount equal to $250,000 or twenty-five per cent of the annual reinsurance premiums managed by the reinsurance intermediary-manager, whichever is greater, except that the policy limits under this paragraph shall not exceed $10,000,000; and</p>

<p>(3) Provide any other report required by the commissioner.</p>

<p>At the commissioner&rsquo;s request, the reinsurance intermediary-manager shall provide the commissioner with proof of the bond and the policy, and appropriate documentation to show that the bond and the policy continue to be in effect or that a new bond and a new policy have been secured.</p>

<p>(d)(1) The commissioner may issue a reinsurance intermediary license to any person, firm, association, or corporation that has complied with the requirements of this article. Any such license issued to a firm or association shall authorize all the members of that firm or association and any designated employees to act as reinsurance intermediaries under the license, and all those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements thereto. Any such license issued to a corporation shall authorize all of the officers, and any designated employees and directors thereof to act as reinsurance intermediaries on behalf of the corporation, and all those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements thereto.</p>

<p>(2) If the applicant for a reinsurance intermediary license is a nonresident, the applicant, as a condition precedent to receiving or holding a license, shall designate the commissioner as agent for service of process in the manner, and with the same legal effect, provided for by this article for service of process upon unauthorized insurers; and also shall furnish the commissioner with the name and address of a resident of this State upon whom notices or orders of the commissioner or process affecting the nonresident reinsurance intermediary may be served. The licensee shall promptly notify the commissioner in writing of every change in its designated agent for service of process, and such change shall not become effective until acknowledged by the commissioner.</p>

<p>(3) The commissioner shall issue a nonresident reinsurance intermediary license if:</p>

<p>(A) The applicant is currently licensed as a resident reinsurance intermediary or insurance producer pursuant to article 9A and in good standing in the applicant&rsquo;s home state;</p>

<p>(B) The applicant has submitted the proper request for licensure and paid the fees required by section 431:7-101;</p>

<p>&copy; The applicant has submitted or transmitted to the commissioner the application for licensure that the applicant submitted to the applicant&rsquo;s home state, or in lieu of the same, a completed uniform application; and</p>

<p>(D) The person&rsquo;s home state awards nonresident licenses to residents of this State on the same basis.</p>

<p>(e) The commissioner may refuse to issue a reinsurance intermediary license if, in the commissioner&rsquo;s judgment, the applicant, anyone named on the application, or any member, principal, officer, or director of the applicant, is not trustworthy, or that any controlling person of the applicant is not trustworthy to act as a reinsurance intermediary, or that any of the foregoing has given cause for revocation or suspension of such license, or has failed to comply with any prerequisite for the issuance of the license. Upon written request therefor, the commissioner shall furnish a summary of the basis for refusal to issue a license, which document shall be privileged and not subject to disclosure pursuant to chapter 92F.</p>

<p>(f) Licensed attorneys at law of this State when acting in their professional capacity as such shall be exempt from this section.</p>

<p>(g) Licensing procedure, duration, and related matters affecting reinsurance intermediaries shall be governed by articles 7 and 9A. [L 1992, c 176, pt of §6; am L 2001, c 136, §2; am L 2004, c 122, §29; am L 2006, c 189, §6; am L 2012, c 66, §11]</p>
