All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than three days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.

(5) The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person&amp;rsquo;s expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control. (e) All statements, amendments, or other material filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b), and all notices of public hearings held pursuant to subsection (d), shall be mailed by the insurer to its shareholders within five business days after the insurer has received the statements, amendments, other material, or notices. The expenses of mailing shall be borne by the person making the filing. As security for the payment of the expenses, the person shall file with the commissioner an acceptable bond or other deposit in an amount to be determined by the commissioner. (f) The provisions of this section shall not apply to: (1) Any transaction which is subject to the provisions of article 4, dealing with the merger or consolidation of two or more insurers; or (2) Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt therefrom as: (A) Not having been made or entered into for the purpose of, and not having the effect of, changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer; or (B) Not otherwise comprehended within the purposes of this section. (g) The following shall be violations of this article: (1) The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b); or (2) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of, control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given approval. (h) The courts of this State are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled or authorized to do business in this State who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and overall actions involving the person arising out of violations of this article. Each person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by the person of the commissioner to be the person&amp;rsquo;s true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of violations of this article. Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to the person at the person&amp;rsquo;s last known address.
