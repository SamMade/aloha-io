The commissioner shall determine those instances in which the party seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest in an insurer will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. The information shall remain confidential until the conclusion of the transaction unless the commissioner, in the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s discretion, determines that confidential treatment will interfere with enforcement of this section. If the statement referred to in paragraph (1) is otherwise filed, this paragraph shall not apply. (3) With respect to a transaction subject to this section, the acquiring person shall also file a preacquisition notification with the commissioner containing the information set forth in section 431:11-104.3(b).

The insurer shall send the amendment to its shareholders. &amp;copy; If any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition referred to in subsection (a) is proposed to be made by means of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 or in circumstances requiring the disclosure of similar information under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or under a state law requiring similar registration or disclosure, the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) may utilize the documents in furnishing the information called for by that statement. (d)(1) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (a) unless, after a public hearing thereon, the commissioner finds that: (A) After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsection (a) would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed; (B) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this State or tend to create a monopoly therein. In applying the competitive standard in this subparagraph: (i) The informational requirements of section 431:11-104.3(b) and the standards of section 431:11-104.4(b) shall apply; (ii) The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the commissioner finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by section 431:11-104.4&amp;copy; exist; and (iii) The commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the grounds for disapproval within a specified period of time; &amp;copy; The financial condition of any acquiring party might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders; (D) The plans or proposals that the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer or not in the public interest; (E) The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer or not in the public interest; or (F) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance-buying public. (2) The public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) shall commence within thirty days after the statement required by subsection (a) is filed, except that the hearing may commence within such additional time as agreed to by the commissioner, the acquiring party, and the person to be acquired, and at least twenty days notice of the scheduled public hearing shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement. Not less than seven days notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to any other persons as may be designated by the commissioner. The insurer shall give notice to its security holders. The commissioner shall make a determination within the sixty-day period preceding the effective date of the proposed transaction. At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected thereby shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection therewith shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in chapter 91. All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than three days prior to the commencement of the public hearing. (3) If the proposed acquisition of control requires the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in paragraph (2) may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in subsection (a). The person shall file the statement referred to in subsection (a) with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners within five days of making the request for a public hearing. A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within ten days of the receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (a). A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled. The commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend such hearing, in person or by telecommunication. (4) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the commissioner that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and rules of this State shall be made not later than sixty days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1). (5) The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person&amp;rsquo;s expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control. (e) All statements, amendments, or other material filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b), and all notices of public hearings held pursuant to subsection (d), shall be mailed by the insurer to its shareholders within five business days after the insurer has received the statements, amendments, other material, or notices. The expenses of mailing shall be borne by the person making the filing. As security for the payment of the expenses, the person shall file with the commissioner an acceptable bond or other deposit in an amount to be determined by the commissioner. (f) The provisions of this section shall not apply to: (1) Any transaction which is subject to the provisions of article 4, dealing with the merger or consolidation of two or more insurers; or (2) Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt therefrom as: (A) Not having been made or entered into for the purpose of, and not having the effect of, changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer; or (B) Not otherwise comprehended within the purposes of this section. (g) The following shall be violations of this article: (1) The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b); or (2) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of, control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given approval. (h) The courts of this State are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled or authorized to do business in this State who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and overall actions involving the person arising out of violations of this article. Each person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by the person of the commissioner to be the person&amp;rsquo;s true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of violations of this article. Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to the person at the person&amp;rsquo;s last known address.
