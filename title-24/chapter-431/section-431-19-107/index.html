      <p><strong>§431:19-107 Financial statements and other reports.</strong> (a) Each captive insurance company other than a risk retention captive insurance company shall submit to the commissioner financial statements reporting the financial condition and the results of operations of the insurer written according to generally accepted accounting principles, or other comprehensive basis of accounting as may be deemed appropriate by the commissioner, and audited by an independent certified public accountant, or other qualified professional as deemed appropriate by the commissioner, on or before the last day of the sixth month following the end of the company&rsquo;s fiscal year.</p>

<p>(b) Each risk retention captive insurance company shall annually file with the commissioner the following:</p>

<p>(1) Annual statement and audit:</p>

<p>(A) On or before March 1, or such day subsequent thereto as the commissioner upon request and for cause may specify, an annual statement using the National Association of Insurance Commissioners&rsquo; annual statement blank plus any additional information required by the commissioner, which shall be a true statement of its financial condition, transactions, and affairs as of the immediately preceding December 31. The reported information shall be verified by oaths of at least two of the captive&rsquo;s principal officers;</p>

<p>(B) On or before June 1, or any day subsequent thereto as the commissioner upon request and for cause may specify, an audit by a designated independent certified public accountant or accounting firm of the financial statements reporting the financial condition and results of the operation of the captive; and</p>

<p>&copy; The annual statement and audit shall be prepared in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners&rsquo; annual statement instructions, accounting practices and procedures manual, and rules adopted by the commissioner following the practices and procedures prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; and</p>

<p>(2) On or before each March 1, or any day subsequent thereto as the commissioner upon request and for cause may specify, a risk-based capital report in accordance with section 431:3-402.</p>

<p>&copy; The statements required to be filed in subsections (a) and (b) shall include but not be limited to actuarially appropriate reserves for the business underwritten. An actuarial opinion regarding reserves for the business underwritten by the company shall be included in the audited statements, except that the actuarial opinion for class 3 companies shall be filed with the annual statement required under subsection (b), on or before March 1 each year. The actuarial opinion shall be given by a member of the American Academy of Actuaries or other qualified loss reserve specialist as defined in the annual statement adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; provided that all captive insurance companies, other than a class 3 company, may, alternatively, utilize an actuarial opinion prepared by a loss reserve specialist deemed appropriate by the commissioner.</p>

<p>(d) The commissioner may prescribe the format and frequency of other reports which may include, but shall not be limited to, summary loss reports and quarterly financial statements.</p>

<p>(e) The commissioner may suspend or revoke the certificate of authority or fine any captive insurer that fails to file any of the documents or reports required by this section. The fine shall be not more than $500 per day past the due date.</p>

<p>(f) Each branch captive insurance company shall file with the commissioner copies of all reports and financial statements required to be filed by the outside captive insurance company of the branch captive insurance company under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the outside captive insurance company is domiciled. The copies of the reports and financial statements shall be certified under oath by two officers of the outside captive insurance company and shall be filed with the commissioner no later than thirty days after the reports and financial statements are filed with the insurance regulator of the domicile of the outside captive insurance company. In addition to, and at the same time as the foregoing filings with the commissioner, the outside captive insurance company shall file a statement signed by two of its executive officers, one of which must be the president or chief financial officer, setting forth the gross premiums written, reinsurance ceded and accepted, and reserves and other liabilities associated with the insurance business written through the branch captive insurance company in this State.</p>

<p>If the commissioner is not satisfied that the reports, financial statements, and statement required to be filed under this subsection fairly and adequately describe the financial condition of the outside captive insurance company and the business underwritten through the branch captive insurance company in this State, the commissioner may require the branch captive insurance company to file an annual statement pursuant to subsection (a) within a reasonable time after notification of such requirement.
