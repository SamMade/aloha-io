The amount recoverable by the liquidator from reinsurers shall not be reduced as a result of delinquency proceedings, regardless of any provision in the reinsurance contract or other agreement. Payment made directly to an insured or other creditor shall not diminish the reinsurer&amp;rsquo;s obligation to the insurer&amp;rsquo;s estate except when the reinsurance contract provided for direct coverage of a named insured and the payment was made in discharge of that obligation.
