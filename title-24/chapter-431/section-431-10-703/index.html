<p>(1) While the transportation network company driver is logged onto the transportation network company&rsquo;s digital network or software application service; and</p>

<p>(2) While the transportation network company driver is engaged in a prearranged ride.</p>

<p>&copy; The following motor vehicle insurance requirements shall apply while a participating transportation network company driver is logged onto the transportation network company&rsquo;s digital network or software application service and is available to receive transportation requests but is not engaged in a prearranged ride:</p>

<p>&copy; Any combination of subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>

<p>(e) If insurance maintained pursuant to subsection &copy; or (d) has lapsed or does not provide the required coverage, the transportation network company insurer shall provide the coverage required by this section beginning with the first dollar of a claim and shall have the duty to defend the claim.</p>

<p>(f) Insurers providing the motor vehicle insurance policies pursuant to this section shall offer the following optional coverages, which any named insured may elect to reject or purchase:</p>

<p>(1) Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages for the transportation network company driver and passengers, as provided in section 431:10C-301, which shall be equal to the primary liability limits specified in subsections &copy; and (d); provided that uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage offers shall also provide for written rejection of the coverages as provided in section 431:10C-301;</p>

<p>(j) Insurance satisfying the requirements of this section shall be deemed to satisfy the financial responsibility requirement for a motor vehicle under chapter 287, the motor vehicle safety responsibility act.</p>

<p>(k) A transportation network company driver shall carry proof of coverage that meets the requirements of subsections &copy; and (d) at all times during the transportation network company driver&rsquo;s use of a personal vehicle in connection with a transportation network company&rsquo;s digital network or software application service. In the event of an accident, a transportation network company driver shall provide this insurance coverage information to the directly interested parties, motor vehicle insurers, and investigating police officers, upon request. Upon such request, a transportation network company driver shall also disclose to directly interested parties, motor vehicle insurers, and investigating police officers whether the transportation network company driver was logged on to the transportation network company&rsquo;s digital network or software application service or engaged in a prearranged ride at the time of the accident.</p>

<p>(l) Unless specified in the personal motor vehicle insurance policy or endorsement, nothing in this section shall be construed to require a personal motor vehicle insurance policy maintained by a transportation network company driver to provide primary or excess coverage while engaged in a prearranged ride. While the transportation network company driver is engaged in a prearranged ride, and notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the following shall apply:</p>

<p>(1) The transportation network company driver&rsquo;s or the vehicle owner&rsquo;s personal motor vehicle insurance policy shall not be required to provide any coverage to any person or entity unless the policy expressly provides for that coverage while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride, with or without a separate charge, or the policy contains an amendment or endorsement to provide coverage while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride, for which a separately stated premium may be charged; and</p>

<p>(2) The transportation network company driver&rsquo;s or the vehicle owner&rsquo;s personal motor vehicle insurance policy shall not be required to provide a duty to defend or indemnify the driver&rsquo;s activities in connection with the transportation network company, unless the policy expressly provides otherwise while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride, with or without a separate charge, or the policy contains an amendment or endorsement to provide coverage while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride, for which a separately stated premium may be charged.</p>

<p>(m) This section shall not restrict any motor vehicle insurance policy coverage applicable to a passenger or pedestrian, other than the limitations in the transportation network company driver&rsquo;s or the vehicle owner&rsquo;s personal motor vehicle insurance policy described in subsection (l).</p>

<p>(n) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a personal motor vehicle insurer may, at its discretion, offer a motor vehicle liability insurance policy, or an amendment or endorsement to an existing policy that covers a private passenger vehicle, station wagon type vehicle, sport utility vehicle, or similar type of vehicle with a passenger capacity of eight persons or less, including the driver, while the driver is logged onto the transportation network company&rsquo;s digital network or software application service, or while engaged in a prearranged ride, if the policy expressly provides for coverage while the driver is logged onto the transportation network company&rsquo;s digital network or software application service or engaged in prearranged rides, with or without a separate charge, or the policy contains an amendment or an endorsement to provide coverage while the driver is logged onto the transportation network company&rsquo;s digital network or software application service or engaged in a prearranged ride, for which a separately stated premium may be charged.</p>

<p>(o) Notwithstanding any other law affecting whether one or more policies of insurance that may apply with respect to an occurrence is primary or excess, this section shall determine the obligations under insurance policies issued to transportation network companies and, if applicable, transportation network company drivers.
