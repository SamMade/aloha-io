      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Insurance Code</h2>
      <p><strong>§431:10D-305 Standard provisions required.</strong> No policy of industrial life insurance shall be issued or delivered unless it contains in substance the provisions as required by this part, or provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the policyholder. There shall be a provision that:</p>

<p>(1) Grace period. The insured is entitled to a grace period of four weeks within which the payment of any premium after the first may be made, except that in policies the premiums for which are payable monthly, the grace period shall be not less than thirty days; and that during such period the policy shall continue in full force, but if during the grace period the policy becomes a claim, then any overdue and unpaid premiums may be deducted from any settlement under the policy;</p>

<p>(2) Entire contract. The policy shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, or, if a copy of the application is endorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued, the policy and the application therefor shall constitute the entire contract. If the application is so made a part of the contract, the policy shall also provide that all statements made by the applicant in the application shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed to be representations and not warranties;</p>

<p>(3) Incontestability. The policy shall be incontestable after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a specific period not more than two years from its date of issue, except for nonpayment of premiums and except for provisions relative to benefits in the event of total and permanent disability and provisions which grant additional insurance specifically against death by accident or accidental means;</p>

<p>(4) Misstatement of age. If it is found that the age of the individual insured, or the age of any other individual considered in determining the premium, has been misstated, any amount payable or benefit accruing under the policy shall be such as the premium would have purchased at the correct age or ages;</p>

<p>(5) Participation. If a participating policy, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion any divisible surplus accruing on the policy. This provision shall not prohibit the payment of additional dividends on default of payment of premiums or termination of the policy;</p>

<p>(6) Nonforfeiture benefits. There shall be a provision for nonforfeiture benefits as required by section 431:10D-104;</p>

<p>(7) Cash surrender value. There shall be a provision for a cash surrender value as required by section 431:10D-104;</p>

<p>(8) Reinstatement. The policy be reinstated at any time within two years after the date of default in the payment of any premium, unless the policy has been surrendered for its cash value or the period of any extended insurance provided by the policy has expired, upon evidence of insurability, including good health, satisfactory to the insurer and the payment of all overdue premiums, and payment (or, within the limits permitted by the then cash values of the policy, reinstatement) of any other indebtedness to the insurer upon the policy with interest as to both premiums and indebtedness at a rate not exceeding six per cent a year compounded annually;</p>

<p>(9) Payment of claims. When the policy becomes a claim by the death of the insured, settlement shall be made upon surrender of the policy and receipt of due proof of death, or after a specified period not exceeding two months after the surrender and receipt of proof; provided, however, an insurer is also permitted to require that the premium receipt book be delivered to it prior to settlement;</p>

<p>(10) Authority to alter contract. There shall be a provision that no producer shall have the power or authority to waive, change, or alter any of the terms or conditions of any policy; except that, at the option of the insurer, the terms or conditions may be changed by an endorsement signed by a duly authorized officer of the insurer;</p>

<p>(11) Conversion; weekly premium policies. In the case of weekly premium policies granting, upon proper written request and upon presentation of evidence of the insurability of the insured satisfactory to the insurer, the privilege of converting the insured&rsquo;s weekly premium industrial insurance to any form of life insurance with less frequent premium payments regularly issued by the insurer, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed upon with the insurer. The privilege of making the conversion need be granted only if the insurer&rsquo;s weekly premium industrial policies on the life insured, in force as premium paying insurance and on which conversion is requested, grant benefits in event of death, exclusive of additional accidental death benefits and exclusive of any dividend additions, in an amount not less than the minimum amount of the insurance with less frequent premium payments issued by the insurer at the age of the insured on the plan of industrial or ordinary insurance desired; and</p>

<p>(12) Conversion; monthly premium policies. In the case of monthly premium industrial policies, granting, upon written request and upon presentation of evidence of the insurability of the insured satisfactory to the insurer, the privilege of converting the insured&rsquo;s monthly premium industrial insurance to any form of ordinary life insurance regularly issued by the insurer, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed upon with the insurer. The privilege of making the conversions need be granted only if the insurer&rsquo;s monthly premium industrial policies on the life insured, in force as premium paying insurance and on which conversion is requested, grant benefits in event of death, exclusive of additional accidental death benefits and exclusive of any dividend additions, in an amount not less than the minimum amount of ordinary insurance issued by the insured at the age of the insured on the plan of ordinary insurance desired.
