(a) In addition to other requirements of the insurance code, every authorized United States branch shall complete and file the report required of a domestic insurer in article 3, including: (1) Annual and quarterly statements of the business transacted within the United States and the assets held by or for it within the United States for the protection of policyholders and creditors within the United States, and of the liabilities incurred against such assets. The forms shall not contain any statement in regard to its assets and business elsewhere. The statements shall be in the same format required of an insurer domiciled in Hawaii and licensed to write the same kinds of insurance; and (2) A statement of trusteed surplus, in such form as the commissioner may prescribe, as of the end of the same period covered by the statement filed pursuant to paragraph (1). In determining the net amount of the United States branch&amp;rsquo;s liabilities in the United States to be reported in the statement of trusteed surplus, the United States branch shall make adjustments to total liabilities reported on the accompanying annual or quarterly statement as follows: (A) Add back liabilities used to offset admitted assets reported in the accompanying quarterly or annual statement; and (B) Deduct: (i) Unearned premiums on agent&amp;rsquo;s balances or uncollected premiums not more than ninety days past due not exceeding unearned premium reserves carried thereon; (ii) Reinsurance on losses with authorized insurers, less unpaid reinsurance premiums; (iii) Reinsurance recoverables on paid losses from unauthorized insurers that are included as assets in the annual or quarterly statement; but only to the extent a liability for such unauthorized recoverables is included in the liabilities report in the trusteed surplus statement; (iv) Special state deposits held for the exclusive benefit of policyholders, or policyholders and creditors, of any particular state not exceeding net liabilities reported for that state; (v) Secured accrued retrospective premiums; (vi) If a life insurer, the amount of its policy loans to policyholders within the United States, not exceeding the amount of legal reserve required on each such policy; (vii) If a life insurer, the net amount of uncollected and deferred premiums; and (viii) Any other non-trusteed asset that the commissioner determines secures liabilities in a substantially similar manner; and &amp;copy; Provide any additional information that the commissioner may require relating to the total business or assets, or any portion thereof, of the alien insurer. (b) The annual statement and trusteed surplus statement shall be signed and verified by the United States branch manager, attorney-in-fact, or a duly empowered assistant United States branch manager, of the United States branch. The items of securities and other property held under trust deeds shall be certified in the trusteed surplus statement by the United States trustee or trustees. &amp;copy; Every report on examination of a United States branch shall include a trusteed surplus statement as of the date of examination in addition to the general statement of the financial condition of the United States branch.
