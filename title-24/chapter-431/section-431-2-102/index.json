For health companies, a grievance is a written complaint submitted by or on behalf of a covered person. &amp;ldquo;Comprehensive market conduct examination&amp;rdquo; means a review of one or more lines of business of an insurer domiciled in this State that is not conducted for cause. The term includes a review of rating, tier classification, underwriting, policyholder service, claims, marketing and sales, producer licensing, complaint handling practices, and compliance procedures and policies. &amp;ldquo;Insurance compliance audit&amp;rdquo; means a voluntary, internal evaluation, review, assessment, audit, or investigation for the purpose of identifying or preventing noncompliance with, or promoting compliance with laws, regulations, orders, or industry or professional standards, which is conducted by or on behalf of an insurer, or which involves an insurer activity regulated by the commissioner. &amp;ldquo;Insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document&amp;rdquo; means documents prepared as a result of or in connection with an insurance compliance audit. An insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document may include a written response to the findings of an insurance compliance audit.
