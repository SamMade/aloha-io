In the discretion of the commissioner, this examination may include an examination of any or all of the business records of the insurer, and an audit of all or any part of the insurer&amp;rsquo;s motor vehicle insurance business, each to be performed by the commissioner&amp;rsquo;s staff or by independent consultants.

The commissioner may, at any time, make and enforce such a requirement of any licensed insurer or self-insurer. (b) The commissioner, prior to issuing a certificate of self-insurance to any person, shall require the applicant to provide for a complete claims service office and an officer for the purpose of service of process in this State. &amp;copy; A member-owned reciprocal insurer and its wholly owned insurer subsidiaries shall make satisfactory arrangements for claims service and adjustment and for policy service of all policies sold or issued to consumers in this State if: (1) A majority of its members are members of the United States military services, veterans of the United States military services, current or former spouses or dependents of these persons; and (2) The primary purpose of the insurer is to serve these persons. The member-owned reciprocal insurer and its wholly owned insurer subsidiaries, upon request by the commissioner, shall provide in writing, specific information as to those arrangements.
