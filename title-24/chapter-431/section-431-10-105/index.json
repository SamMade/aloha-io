The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to sickness as may begin more than ten days after that date. In all other respects, the insured and insurer shall have the same rights as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.
