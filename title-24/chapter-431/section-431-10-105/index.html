      <p><strong>[§431:10H-105] Extraterritorial jurisdiction; group policies.</strong> No group long-term insurance coverage may be offered to a resident of this State under a group policy issued in another state to a group described in paragraph (4) under the definition of &ldquo;group long-term care insurance&rdquo; in section 431:10H-104, unless this State or another state having statutory and regulatory long-term care insurance requirements substantially similar to those adopted in this State has made a determination that these requirements have been met. [L 1999, c 93, pt of §2]oup of producers.</p>

<p>(b) The commissioner may examine and investigate the insurance related activities of any person whom the commissioner believes may be in violation of this section. Any person may submit to the commissioner a complaint or any material pertinent to the enforcement of this section.</p>

<p>&copy; Nothing in this section shall prevent a person who grants, awards, or issues contracts for the construction or renovation of improvements to real property from requiring a person to acquire or negotiate a surety bond or other contract guaranteeing completion of the improvements through authorized surety insurers or producers licensed to do business in the State or both. [L 2007, c 251, §1]graph (4), the contract shall be incontestable after it has been in force during the lifetime of the person or of each of the persons as to whom such statements are required, for a period of two years from its date of issue, except for nonpayment of stipulated payments to the insurer. At the option of the insurer, the contract may also except any provisions relative to benefits in the event of disability and any provisions that grant insurance specifically against death by accident or accidental means.</p>

<p>(3) Entire contract. The contract shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, or, if a copy of the application is endorsed upon or attached to the contract when issued, a provision that the contract and the application therefor shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.</p>

<p>(4) Misstatement of age or sex. If the age or sex of the person or persons upon whose life or lives the contract is made, or of any of them, has been misstated, the amount payable or benefit accruing under the contract shall be such as the stipulated payment or payments to the insurer would have purchased according to the correct age or sex; and that if the insurer makes or has made any overpayment on account of any such misstatement, the amount thereof, with interest at the rate to be specified in the contract but not exceeding six per cent a year, may be charged against the current or next succeeding payment to be made by the insurer under the contract.</p>

<p>(5) Dividends. In participating contracts the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion any divisible surplus accruing on the contract except that at the option of the insurer the participation may be deferred to the end of the third contract year.</p>

<p>(6) Reinstatement. The contract may be reinstated at any time within one year from the date of default in making stipulated payments to the insurer, unless the cash surrender value has been paid, but all overdue stipulated payments and any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract shall be paid or reinstated, with interest thereon at a rate to be specified in the contract but not exceeding six per cent a year compounded annually. In cases where applicable, the insurer may also include a requirement of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer.</p>

<p>(b) Provisions of this section shall not apply to:</p>

<p>(1) Reversionary annuities or survivorship annuities;</p>

<p>(2) Contracts for annuities included in, or upon the lives of beneficiaries under, life insurance policies; or</p>

<p>(3) Single premium annuities or single premium pure endowment contracts. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 2004, c 122, §46]its intention not to renew this policy beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(4) (A) &ldquo;Reinstatement: If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted to the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept the premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided that if the insurer or agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy shall be reinstated upon approval of the application by the insurer or, lacking approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of the application. The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to sickness as may begin more than ten days after that date. In all other respects, the insured and insurer shall have the same rights as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with the reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(B) The last sentence in subparagraph (A) may be omitted from any policy that the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums until at least age fifty or, in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue;</p>

<p>(5) (A) &ldquo;Notice of Claim: Written notice of claim shall be given to the insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at (insert the location of the office as the insurer may designate for the purpose) or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(B) In a policy providing a loss of time benefit that may be payable for at least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the first and second sentences in subparagraph (A): &ldquo;Subject to the qualification set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least two years, the insured shall, at least once in every six months after having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of the disability, except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of the claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision. Delay in giving notice shall not impair the insured&rsquo;s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which notice is actually given&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(6) &ldquo;Claim Forms: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant any forms that are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss. If the forms are not furnished within fifteen days after the giving of notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character, and the extent of the loss for which claim is made&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(7) &ldquo;Proofs of Loss: In case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss, written proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its office within ninety days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable, and in case of claim for any other loss within ninety days after the date of loss. Failure to furnish proof of loss within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within the time required, provided proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except the absence of legal capacity, later than fifteen months from the time proof is otherwise required&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(8) &ldquo;Time of Payment of Claims: Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment shall be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment shall be paid (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability shall be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(9) (A) &ldquo;Payment of Claims: Indemnity for loss of life shall be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment. If no designation or provision is then effective, the indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured&rsquo;s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to the designated beneficiary or to the estate of the insured. All other indemnities shall be payable to the insured&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(B) Either or both of the following provisions may be included with the provision set forth in subparagraph (A) at the option of the insurer:</p>

<p>(i) &ldquo;If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay the indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $2,000 to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of the payment&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(ii) &ldquo;Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer&rsquo;s option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering the services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(10) &ldquo;Physical Examinations and Autopsy: The insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law&rdquo;;</p>

<p>(11) &ldquo;Legal Actions: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of sixty days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy.  No action at law or in equity shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(12) (A) &ldquo;Change of Beneficiary: Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change the beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(B) The first clause of subparagraph (A), relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer&rsquo;s option. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 1993, c 205, §22; am L 2002, c 155, §52; am L 2004, c 122, §31; am L 2010, c 116, §1(15); am L 2011, c 43, §15]</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Paragraphs (2)(A) and &copy; liberally construed to prevent disability insurer from excluding coverage of insured&rsquo;s total disability due to HIV infection based on contractual provisions. 86 H. 262, 948 P.2d 1103.</p>

<p>Under this article and paragraph (2)(A)(ii), standard &ldquo;incontestability clause&rdquo; of contract precluded insurer from denying insured &ldquo;total disability benefit&rdquo; contracted for, notwithstanding that HIV infection that caused the disability arguably &ldquo;manifested&rdquo; itself prior to policy&rsquo;s effective date of coverage. 86 H. 262, 948 P.2d 1103.</p>
