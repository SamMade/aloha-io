      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Policy revisions that alter coverage</h2>
      <p><strong>§431:14G-105 Rate filings.</strong> (a) Every managed care plan shall file with the commissioner every rate, charge, classification, schedule, practice, or rule and every modification of any of the foregoing that it proposes to use. Every filing shall:</p>

<p>(1) State its proposed effective date;</p>

<p>(2) Indicate the character and extent of the coverage contemplated;</p>

<p>(3) Include a report on investment income; and</p>

<p>(4) Be accompanied by a $50 fee payable to the commissioner which shall be deposited in the commissioner&rsquo;s education and training fund.</p>

<p>(b) For each filing, an insurer shall submit to the commissioner:</p>

<p>(1) An electronic copy of the filing; or</p>

<p>(2) Two printed copies of the filing;</p>

<p>provided that the commissioner may request an insurer that submits an electronic copy of the filing pursuant to paragraph (1) to also submit a printed copy of the electronic filing.</p>

<p>&copy; At the same time as the filing of the rate, every managed care plan shall file all supplementary rating and supporting information to be used in support of or in conjunction with a rate. The managed care plan may satisfy its obligation to file supplementary rating and supporting information by reference to material that has been approved by the commissioner. The information furnished in support of a filing may include or consist of a reference to:</p>

<p>(1) Its interpretation of any statistical data upon which it relies;</p>

<p>(2) The experience of other managed care plans; or</p>

<p>(3) Any other relevant factors.</p>

<p>(d) When a filing is not accompanied by supporting information or the commissioner does not have sufficient information to determine whether the filing meets the requirements of this article, the commissioner shall require the managed care plan to furnish additional information and, in that event, the waiting period shall commence as of the date the information is furnished. Until the requested information is provided, the filing shall not be deemed complete or filed and the filing shall not be used by the managed care plan. If the requested information is not provided within a reasonable time period, the filing may be returned to the managed care plan as not filed and not available for use. Rates shall be open to public inspection upon filing with the commissioner; provided that the commissioner establishes rules to ensure that confidential and proprietary information is protected and shall not be subject to public inspection.</p>

<p>(e) Rates shall be established in accordance with actuarial principles, based on reasonable assumptions, and supported by adequate supporting and supplementary rating information. After reviewing a managed care plan&rsquo;s filing, the commissioner may require that the managed care plan&rsquo;s rates be based upon the managed care plan&rsquo;s own loss and expense information.</p>

<p>(f) The commissioner shall review filings promptly after the filings have been made to determine whether the filings meet the requirements of this article.</p>

<p>(g) Except as provided herein, each filing shall be on file for a waiting period of sixty days before the filing becomes effective. The period may be extended by the commissioner for an additional period not to exceed fifteen days if the commissioner gives written notice within the waiting period to the managed care plan that made the filing, that the commissioner needs the additional time for the consideration of the filing. Upon written application by the managed care plan, the commissioner may authorize a filing that the commissioner has reviewed, to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension thereof. A filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this article unless disapproved by the commissioner, as provided in section 431:14G-107, within the waiting period or any extension thereof. The rates shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this article until the time the commissioner reviews the filing and so long as the filing remains in effect.</p>

<p>(h) If the commissioner finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this article, the commissioner, as provided in section 431:14G-107, shall send the managed care plan a notice of disapproval within the applicable sixty-day period or fifteen-day extension provided by subsection (g).</p>

<p>(i) The commissioner, by written order, may suspend or modify the requirement of filing as to any class of health insurance, subdivision, or combination thereof, or as to classes of risks, the rates which cannot practicably be filed before they are used. The order shall be made known to the affected managed care plan. The commissioner may make examinations that the commissioner deems advisable to ascertain whether any rates affected by the order meet the standards set forth in section 431:14G-103.</p>

<p>(j) No managed care plan shall make or issue a contract or policy except in accordance with filings that are in effect for the managed care plan as provided in this article.</p>

<p>(k) The commissioner may make the following rate effective when filed: any special filing with respect to any class of health insurance, subdivision, or combination thereof that is subject to individual risk premium modification and has been agreed to under a formal or informal bid process.</p>

<p>(l) For managed care plans having annual premium revenues of less than $10,000,000, the commissioner may adopt rules and procedures that will provide the commissioner with sufficient facts necessary to determine the reasonableness of the proposed rates without unduly burdening the managed care plan and its enrollees; provided that the rates meet the standards of section 431:14G-103.</p>

<p>(m) Subsections (a) through (l) shall not apply to third party administrator services, prepaid dental insurance offered by managed care plans, prepaid vision insurance offered by managed care plans and disability insurers licensed under chapter 431. For managed care plans with rates based totally or in part on the individual group&rsquo;s claims experience, insurers subject to this subsection shall submit to the commissioner for approval descriptions of the methodology to be used in creating rates and every modification thereof that it proposes to use. The description of methodology shall contain specific information allowing a determination of rates that meet the standards of section 431:14G-103(a) and supporting information and justification. Every filing shall state its proposed effective date and shall indicate the character and extent of the coverage contemplated. Complete supporting and supplementary rating information for rates shall be maintained and made available to the commissioner upon request. [L 2007, c 175, pt of §2; am L 2011, c 81, §9]</p>
