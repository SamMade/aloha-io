  "context": "PART II. PRIVACY AND OPT OUT NOTICES FOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION §431:3A-201 Initial privacy notice to consumers required. (a) A licensee shall provide a clear and conspicuous notice that accurately reflects its privacy policies and practices to a consumer: (1) Not later than when the licensee establishes a customer relationship, except as provided in subsection (d); and (2) Before the licensee discloses any nonpublic personal financial information about the consumer to any nonaffiliated third party, if the licensee makes a disclosure other than as authorized by sections 431:3A-402 and 431:3A-403. (b) A licensee shall not be required to provide an initial notice to a consumer under subsection (a)(2) if: (1) The licensee does not disclose any nonpublic personal financial information about the consumer to any nonaffiliated third party, other than as authorized by sections 431:3A-402 and 431:3A-403, and the licensee does not have a customer relationship with the consumer; provided that for purpose of this paragraph, a licensee establishes a customer relationship at the time the licensee and the consumer enter into a continuing relationship; and (2) A notice has been provided by an affiliated licensee, if the notice clearly identifies all licensees to whom the notice applies and is accurate with respect to the licensee and the other institutions. &amp;copy; When an existing customer obtains a new insurance product or service from a licensee that is to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, the licensee shall be deemed to satisfy the initial notice requirements of subsection (a) if: (1) The licensee provides a revised privacy notice, under section 431:3A-205, that covers the customer&amp;rsquo;s new insurance product or service; or (2) The initial, revised, or annual notice that the licensee most recently provided to that customer was accurate with respect to the new insurance product or service, in which case the licensee does not need to provide a new privacy notice under subsection (a). (d) A licensee may provide the initial notice under subsection (a)(1) within a reasonable time after the licensee establishes a customer relationship if: (1) Establishing the customer relationship is not at the customers election; or (2) Providing notice not later than when the licensee establishes a customer relationship would substantially delay the customers transaction and the customer agrees to receive the notice at a later time. (e) When a licensee is required to deliver an initial privacy notice by this section, the licensee shall deliver it according to section 431:3A-206. If the licensee uses a short-form initial notice for noncustomers according to section 431:3A-203&amp;copy;, the licensee may deliver its privacy notice according to section 431:3A-206.
