<p><strong>[§205-41] Declaration of policy</strong>. It is declared that the people of Hawaii have a substantial interest in the health and sustainability of agriculture as an industry in the State. There is a compelling state interest in conserving the State&rsquo;s agricultural land resource base and assuring the long-term availability of agricultural lands for agricultural use to achieve the purposes of:</p>

<p>(1) Conserving and protecting agricultural lands;</p>

<p>(2) Promoting diversified agriculture;</p>

<p>(3) Increasing agricultural self-sufficiency; and</p>

<p>(4) Assuring the availability of agriculturally suitable lands,</p>

<p>pursuant to article XI, section 3, of the Hawaii State Constitution. [L 2005, c 183, pt of §2]</p>

<p>L 2005, c 183, §§9 and 10 provide:</p>

<p>(1) That agricultural incentive programs to promote agricultural viability, sustained growth of the agricultural industry, and the long-term use and protection of important agricultural lands for agricultural use shall be developed concurrently with the process of identifying important agricultural lands as required under section 2 of this Act [sections 205-41 to 205-52]; and</p>

<p>(2) That the designation of important agricultural lands and adoption of maps by the land use commission pursuant to section 2 of this Act [sections 205-41 to 205-52] shall take effect only upon the enactment of legislation establishing incentives and protections for important agricultural lands contemplated by section [205-46] and shall be satisfied by:</p>

<p>(A) Providing a declaration of satisfaction within the Act that establishes incentives for important agricultural lands; or</p>

<p>(B) Having the legislature adopt a concurrent resolution declaring the satisfaction of implementing incentives for important agricultural lands by identifying the specific measures or Acts that establish incentives for important agricultural lands.</p>

<p>(b) Pursuant to section [205-46], Hawaii Revised Statutes, the department of agriculture, with the assistance of the department of taxation, shall contract appropriate meeting facilitation and cost-benefit analysis services to develop and recommend a package of proposals for agricultural incentives and other measures that promote agricultural viability, sustained growth of the agricultural industry, and the long-term use and protection of important agricultural lands.</p>

<p>The department of agriculture, in consultation with the department of taxation, shall use consultants to promote a facilitated meeting process and deliberation and seek the assistance and input from the Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation, landowners, affected state and county agencies, other stakeholders, and persons with relevant expertise that are necessary to develop and implement a comprehensive and integrated framework of incentives and programs that will promote agricultural viability, sustained growth of the agricultural industry, and the long-term use and protection of important agricultural lands for agricultural use in Hawaii, including tax policy, agricultural business development and financing, marketing, and agricultural land use techniques. The meeting facilitators shall ensure that stakeholder discussions are inclusive and use a consistent voting procedure.</p>

<p>The department of agriculture shall report stakeholder findings and recommendations, including proposed legislation and a recommended minimum criteria for determining when the &ldquo;enactment of legislation establishing incentives and protection&rdquo; has occurred for the purposes of this Act, to the legislature no later than twenty days before the convening of the regular session of 2007. The report shall include an analysis of the impacts and benefits of its recommendations, a record of the stakeholder group&rsquo;s process and deliberations, and shall provide the supporting rationale for the incentives being proposed.</p>

<p>&copy; Incentives and other programs to promote agricultural viability, sustained growth of the agricultural industry, and the long-term use and protection of important agricultural lands for agricultural use in Hawaii by farmers and landowners to be considered by the department of agriculture shall include but not be limited to the following:</p>

<p>(1) Assistance in identifying federal, state, and private grant and loan resources for agricultural business planning and operations, assistance with grant and loan application processes, and the processing of grants and loans;</p>

<p>(2) Real property tax systems that support the needs of agriculture, including property tax assessment of land and improvements used or held only for use in agriculture based on agricultural use value rather than fair market value;</p>

<p>(3) Reduced infrastructure requirements and facilitated building permit processes for the construction of dedicated agricultural structures;</p>

<p>(4) Tax incentives that include but are not limited to:</p>

<p>(A) Tax credits for the sale or donation of agricultural easements on important agricultural lands; and</p>

<p>(B) General excise tax exemption for retail sales of farm produce;</p>

<p>(5) Incentives that promote investment in agricultural businesses or value-added agricultural development, and other agricultural financing mechanisms;</p>

<p>(6) Incentives and programs that promote long-term or permanent agricultural land protection, and the establishment of a dedicated funding source for these programs;</p>

<p>(7) Establishment of a permanent state revolving fund, escalating tax credits based on the tax revenues generated by increased investment or agricultural activities conducted on important agricultural lands, and dedicated funding sources to provide moneys for incentives and other programs;</p>

<p>(8) Establishment of a means to analyze the conformity of state-funded projects with the intent and purposes of part I of this Act [sections 205-41 to 205-52], and a mechanism for mitigation measures when projects are not in conformance;</p>

<p>(9) Institution of a requirement for the preparation of an agricultural impact statement that would include mitigation measures for adverse impacts for proposed state or county rulemaking that may affect agricultural activities, operations, and agricultural businesses on important agricultural lands; and</p>

<p>(10) Other programs to carry out the intent of part I of this Act [sections 205-41 to 205-52].</p>

<p>SECTION 10. Within one year of the adoption of maps of important agricultural lands by the land use commission for the lands within the jurisdiction of each county, all state agencies shall report to the department of agriculture on the impact of projects and programs on the designated important agricultural lands and sustained agricultural use of these lands. State agencies shall develop implementation programs, as needed, to ensure that their programs are supportive of agriculture and consistent with the intent and purposes of this Act.&rdquo;</p>
