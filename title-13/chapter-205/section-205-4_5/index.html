Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, no subdivision of land within the agricultural district with soil classified by the land study bureau&rsquo;s detailed land classification as overall (master) productivity rating class A or B shall be approved by a county unless those A and B lands within the subdivision are made subject to the restriction on uses as prescribed in this section and to the condition that the uses shall be primarily in pursuit of an agricultural activity.</p>

<p>Any deed, lease, agreement of sale, mortgage, or other instrument of conveyance covering any land within the agricultural subdivision shall expressly contain the restriction on uses and the condition, as prescribed in this section that these restrictions and conditions shall be encumbrances running with the land until such time that the land is reclassified to a land use district other than agricultural district.</p>

<p>If the foregoing requirement of encumbrances running with the land jeopardizes the owner or lessee in obtaining mortgage financing from any of the mortgage lending agencies set forth in the following paragraph, and the requirement is the sole reason for failure to obtain mortgage financing, then the requirement of encumbrances shall, insofar as such mortgage financing is jeopardized, be conditionally waived by the appropriate county enforcement officer; provided that the conditional waiver shall become effective only in the event that the property is subjected to foreclosure proceedings by the mortgage lender.</p>

<p>The mortgage lending agencies referred to in the preceding paragraph are the Federal Housing Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association, Veterans Administration, Small Business Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, Federal Land Bank of Berkeley, Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Berkeley, Berkeley Bank for Cooperatives, and any other federal, state, or private mortgage lending agency qualified to do business in Hawaii, and their respective successors and assigns.</p>

<p>&copy; Within the agricultural district, all lands with soil classified by the land study bureau&rsquo;s detailed land classification as overall (master) productivity rating class C, D, E, or U shall be restricted to the uses permitted for agricultural districts as set forth in section 205-5(b).</p>

<p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, golf courses and golf driving ranges approved by a county before July 1, 2005, for development within the agricultural district shall be permitted uses within the agricultural district.</p>

<p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, plantation community subdivisions as defined in this section shall be permitted uses within the agricultural district, and section 205-8 shall not apply.</p>

<p>[(f)] Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, agricultural lands may be subdivided and leased for the agricultural uses or activities permitted in subsection (a); provided that:</p>

<p>(1) The principal use of the leased land is agriculture;</p>

<p>(2) No permanent or temporary dwellings or farm dwellings, including trailers and campers, are constructed on the leased area. This restriction shall not prohibit the construction of storage sheds, equipment sheds, or other structures appropriate to the agricultural activity carried on within the lot; and</p>

<p>(3) The lease term for a subdivided lot shall be for at least as long as the greater of:</p>

<p>(A) The minimum real property tax agricultural dedication period of the county in which the subdivided lot is located; or</p>

<p>(B) Five years.</p>

<p>Lots created and leased pursuant to this section shall be legal lots of record for mortgage lending purposes and shall be exempt from county subdivision standards.

<p>Avoiding the Next Hokuliยa: The Debate over Hawaiยi&rsquo;s Agricultural Subdivisions. 27 UH L. Rev. 441 (2005).</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), assuming it was constitutional, did not facially invalidate Hawaii&rsquo;s land use law, where plaintiffs challenged this section and ยง205-6 to the extent the sections required a religious organization to obtain a special use permit, as violations of the &ldquo;equal terms&rdquo; and &ldquo;nondiscrimination&rdquo; provisions of the RLUIPA. 229 F. Supp. 2d 1056 (2002).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Communications equipment buildings&rdquo; and &ldquo;utility lines&rdquo; in subsection (a)(7) do not encompass &ldquo;telecommunications antennas&rdquo; or &ldquo;transmission antennas&rdquo; such as a cellular telephone tower; public utility thus had to apply for a special permit under ยง205-6 to place the tower in a state agricultural district. 90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</p>

<p>Under subsection (a)(4) and (10), a chimney and garage are permitted as accessories to a farm dwelling; however, utilizing the chimney to conceal an antenna and the garage to house communication equipment were not permitted uses under either subsection (a)(4) or (10). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930 (2005).</p>

<p>Under the circumstances of the case, the residence and the chimney with the concealed antenna constituted a &ldquo;communications equipment building&rdquo; and, thus, were permitted uses under subsection (a)(7); also, as the garage was not abnormally large and was designed specifically to store the communications equipment for the concealed antenna, utilizing the permitted garage structure to house the communications equipment for the antenna was a permitted use under subsection (a)(7). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930 (2005).</p>
