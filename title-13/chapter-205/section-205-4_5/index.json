If the foregoing requirement of encumbrances running with the land jeopardizes the owner or lessee in obtaining mortgage financing from any of the mortgage lending agencies set forth in the following paragraph, and the requirement is the sole reason for failure to obtain mortgage financing, then the requirement of encumbrances shall, insofar as such mortgage financing is jeopardized, be conditionally waived by the appropriate county enforcement officer; provided that the conditional waiver shall become effective only in the event that the property is subjected to foreclosure proceedings by the mortgage lender.

Law Journals and Reviews Avoiding the Next Hokulia: The Debate over Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s Agricultural Subdivisions. 27 UH L. Rev. 441 (2005). Case Notes Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), assuming it was constitutional, did not facially invalidate Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s land use law, where plaintiffs challenged this section and §205-6 to the extent the sections required a religious organization to obtain a special use permit, as violations of the &amp;ldquo;equal terms&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nondiscrimination&amp;rdquo; provisions of the RLUIPA. 229 F. Supp. 2d 1056 (2002). &amp;ldquo;Communications equipment buildings&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;utility lines&amp;rdquo; in subsection (a)(7) do not encompass &amp;ldquo;telecommunications antennas&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;transmission antennas&amp;rdquo; such as a cellular telephone tower; public utility thus had to apply for a special permit under §205-6 to place the tower in a state agricultural district. 90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822. Under subsection (a)(4) and (10), a chimney and garage are permitted as accessories to a farm dwelling; however, utilizing the chimney to conceal an antenna and the garage to house communication equipment were not permitted uses under either subsection (a)(4) or (10). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930 (2005). Under the circumstances of the case, the residence and the chimney with the concealed antenna constituted a &amp;ldquo;communications equipment building&amp;rdquo; and, thus, were permitted uses under subsection (a)(7); also, as the garage was not abnormally large and was designed specifically to store the communications equipment for the concealed antenna, utilizing the permitted garage structure to house the communications equipment for the antenna was a permitted use under subsection (a)(7). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930 (2005).
