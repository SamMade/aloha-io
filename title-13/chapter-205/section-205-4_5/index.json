Law Journals and Reviews Avoiding the Next Hokuliยa: The Debate over Hawaiยi&amp;rsquo;s Agricultural Subdivisions. 27 UH L. Rev. 441 (2005). Case Notes Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), assuming it was constitutional, did not facially invalidate Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s land use law, where plaintiffs challenged this section and ยง205-6 to the extent the sections required a religious organization to obtain a special use permit, as violations of the &amp;ldquo;equal terms&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nondiscrimination&amp;rdquo; provisions of the RLUIPA. 229 F. Supp. 2d 1056 (2002). &amp;ldquo;Communications equipment buildings&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;utility lines&amp;rdquo; in subsection (a)(7) do not encompass &amp;ldquo;telecommunications antennas&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;transmission antennas&amp;rdquo; such as a cellular telephone tower; public utility thus had to apply for a special permit under ยง205-6 to place the tower in a state agricultural district. 90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822. Under subsection (a)(4) and (10), a chimney and garage are permitted as accessories to a farm dwelling; however, utilizing the chimney to conceal an antenna and the garage to house communication equipment were not permitted uses under either subsection (a)(4) or (10). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930 (2005). Under the circumstances of the case, the residence and the chimney with the concealed antenna constituted a &amp;ldquo;communications equipment building&amp;rdquo; and, thus, were permitted uses under subsection (a)(7); also, as the garage was not abnormally large and was designed specifically to store the communications equipment for the concealed antenna, utilizing the permitted garage structure to house the communications equipment for the antenna was a permitted use under subsection (a)(7). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930 (2005).
