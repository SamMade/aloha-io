The two at-large members nominated by the senate president and speaker of the house and the nine representatives of the respective community development districts shall each be appointed by the governor from a list of three nominees submitted for each position by the nominating authority specified in this subsection.</p>

<p>The authority shall be organized and shall exercise jurisdiction as follows:</p>

<p>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p>Subsection (b) is constitutional, with regard to the use of the phrase &ldquo;appointed and qualified&rdquo; to describe when a successor&rsquo;s appointment terminates a holdover member&rsquo;s position. Att. Gen. Op. 16-3.</p>
