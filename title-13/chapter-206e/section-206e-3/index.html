      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Hawaii community development authority; established</h2>
      <p><strong>§206E-3 Hawaii community development authority; established.</strong> (a) There is established the Hawaii community development authority, which shall be a body corporate and a public instrumentality of the State, for the purpose of implementing this chapter.

<p>All members except the director of finance, director of transportation, county directors of planning and permitting, and chairperson of the Hawaiian homes commission or their designees shall be appointed by the governor pursuant to section 26-34. The two at-large members nominated by the senate president and speaker of the house and the nine representatives of the respective community development districts shall each be appointed by the governor from a list of three nominees submitted for each position by the nominating authority specified in this subsection.</p>

<p>The authority shall be organized and shall exercise jurisdiction as follows:</p>

<p>(1) For matters affecting the Heeia community development district, the following members shall be considered in determining quorum and majority and shall be eligible to vote:</p>

<p>&copy; The cultural specialist;</p>

<p>In the event of a vacancy, a member shall be appointed to fill the vacancy in the same manner as the original appointment within thirty days of the vacancy or within ten days of the senate&rsquo;s rejection of a previous appointment, as applicable.</p>

<p>The terms of the director of finance, director of transportation, county directors of planning and permitting, and chairperson of the Hawaiian homes commission or their respective designees shall run concurrently with each official&rsquo;s term of office. The terms of the appointed voting members shall be for four years, commencing on July 1 and expiring on June 30; provided that the initial terms of all voting members initially appointed pursuant to Act 61, Session Laws of Hawaii 2014, shall commence on March 1, 2015. The governor shall provide for staggered terms of the initially appointed voting members so that the initial terms of four members selected by lot shall be for two years, the initial terms of four members selected by lot shall be for three years, and the initial terms of the remaining five members shall be for four years.</p>

<p>The governor may remove or suspend for cause any member after due notice and public hearing.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding section 92-15, a majority of all eligible voting members as specified in this subsection shall constitute a quorum to do business, and the concurrence of a majority of all eligible voting members as specified in this subsection shall be necessary to make any action of the authority valid. All members shall continue in office until their respective successors have been appointed and qualified. Except as herein provided, no member appointed under this subsection shall be an officer or employee of the State or its political subdivisions.</p>

<p>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p>Subsection (b) is constitutional, with regard to the use of the phrase &ldquo;appointed and qualified&rdquo; to describe when a successor&rsquo;s appointment terminates a holdover member&rsquo;s position. Att. Gen. Op. 16-3.</p>
