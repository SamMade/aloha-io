  "context": "ยง206-6 Acquisition of land within a development area. After the declaration of a development area, the board of land and natural resources may acquire a parcel or parcels of land which it shall thereafter designate for the appropriate development project or projects within the area. If necessary lands cannot reasonably be acquired by voluntary transaction, the board may institute eminent domain proceedings to acquire the land and improvements; provided that negotiations for the acquisition by voluntary transaction shall not be required before the institution of eminent domain proceedings. The board shall, within twelve months next following its designation, acquire or institute eminent domain proceedings to acquire the lands so designated. If the lands are not acquired or eminent domain proceedings instituted within the twelve month period, it shall reimburse the owner of the lands so designated for out-of-pocket expenses of appraisal, survey, and attorney fees as the owner may have incurred as a result of the designation. Subject to the restrictions in the following section, the board may acquire for development projects any lands suitable for residential use or suitable for such use or uses upon subdivision and development. The board may also acquire, in connection with the development projects, lands necessary for roads, sidewalks, parks, schools, utilities, and playground and recreational facilities, and rights to water and access. The board may also acquire, in connection with the development projects, lands for business use where the use is reasonably necessary to provide services to the prospective occupants of the projects. Plans and specifications for projects shall include provisions for roads, sidewalks, parks, schools, utilities, playground and recreational facilities, and other appropriate improvements, so that they will be suitable for disposition as hereinafter provided.
