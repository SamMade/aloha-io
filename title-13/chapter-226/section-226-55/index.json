In the formulation of the functional plan, the preparing agency shall solicit public views and concerns. The formulation and revision of a state functional plan shall conform to the provisions of this chapter and shall take into consideration the county general plans. Functional plans and any revisions thereto shall be approved by the governor to serve as guidelines for funding and implementation by state and county agencies. (b) The functional plan shall identify priority issues in the functional area and shall contain objectives, policies, and implementing actions to address those priority issues. Actions may include organizational or management initiatives, facility or physical infrastructure development initiatives, initiatives for programs and services, or legislative proposals. &amp;copy; For each functional plan, the governor shall establish an advisory committee, where an advisory body which meets the criteria set out hereunder is not already in existence, whose membership shall be composed of at least one public official from each county to be nominated by the mayor of each county; members of the public; experts in the field for which a functional plan is being prepared; and state officials.

If the nominations of county officials by a mayor are not submitted to the governor within sixty days following the date of the governor&amp;rsquo;s request for such nominations, the governor shall appoint at least one public official from that county to serve on the advisory committee without nominations from that mayor. The committee shall advise the state agency in preparing, implementing, monitoring, and updating the functional plan to be in conformance with the overall theme, goals, objectives, policies, and priority guidelines contained within this chapter. The draft functional plan shall be submitted to relevant federal, state, and county agencies for review and input.
