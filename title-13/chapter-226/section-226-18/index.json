  "context": "§226-18 Objectives and policies for facility systems&amp;ndash;energy. (a) Planning for the State&amp;rsquo;s facility systems with regard to energy shall be directed toward the achievement of the following objectives, giving due consideration to all: (1) Dependable, efficient, and economical statewide energy systems capable of supporting the needs of the people; (2) Increased energy security and self-sufficiency through the reduction and ultimate elimination of Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s dependence on imported fuels for electrical generation and ground transportation; (3) Greater diversification of energy generation in the face of threats to Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s energy supplies and systems; (4) Reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply and use; and (5) Utility models that make the social and financial interests of Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s utility customers a priority. (b) To achieve the energy objectives, it shall be the policy of this State to ensure the short- and long-term provision of adequate, reasonably priced, and dependable energy services to accommodate demand. &amp;copy; To further achieve the energy objectives, it shall be the policy of this State to: (1) Support research and development as well as promote the use of renewable energy sources; (2) Ensure that the combination of energy supplies and energy-saving systems is sufficient to support the demands of growth; (3) Base decisions of least-cost supply-side and demand-side energy resource options on a comparison of their total costs and benefits when a least-cost is determined by a reasonably comprehensive, quantitative, and qualitative accounting of their long-term, direct and indirect economic, environmental, social, cultural, and public health costs and benefits; (4) Promote all cost-effective conservation of power and fuel supplies through measures, including: (A) Development of cost-effective demand-side management programs; (B) Education; &amp;copy; Adoption of energy-efficient practices and technologies; and (D) Increasing energy efficiency and decreasing energy use in public infrastructure; (5) Ensure, to the extent that new supply-side resources are needed, that the development or expansion of energy systems uses the least-cost energy supply option and maximizes efficient technologies; (6) Support research, development, demonstration, and use of energy efficiency, load management, and other demand-side management programs, practices, and technologies; (7) Promote alternate fuels and transportation energy efficiency; (8) Support actions that reduce, avoid, or sequester greenhouse gases in utility, transportation, and industrial sector applications; (9) Support actions that reduce, avoid, or sequester Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions through agriculture and forestry initiatives; (10) Provide priority handling and processing for all state and county permits required for renewable energy projects; (11) Ensure that liquefied natural gas is used only as a cost-effective transitional, limited-term replacement of petroleum for electricity generation and does not impede the development and use of other cost-effective renewable energy sources; and (12) Promote the development of indigenous geothermal energy resources that are located on public trust land as an affordable and reliable source of firm power for Hawaii.
