      <p><strong>[PART III.] FINANCING PROGRAMS</strong></p>

<p>A. General Provisions</p>

<p><strong>[ยง201H-71] Bonds; authorization.</strong> (a) The corporation, with the approval of the governor, may issue from time to time bonds (including refunding bonds to pay, retire, or provide for the retirement of bonds previously issued by the corporation) in amounts not exceeding the total amount of bonds authorized to be issued by the legislature for any of its corporate purposes. Bonds may also be issued in connection with any program whose primary purpose is to provide housing for active or retired United States military personnel, their families, and other persons authorized by any branch of the United States military to reside in the housing; provided that the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding bonds issued by the corporation for military housing projects shall total no more than $2,000,000,000.</p>

<p>(b) All bonds shall be issued pursuant to part III of chapter 39, except as provided in this part.</p>

<p>&copy; The bonds shall be issued in the name of the corporation, and not in the name of the State. The final maturity date of the revenue bonds may be any date not exceeding sixty years from the date of issuance.</p>

<p>(d) The corporation may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including without limitation bonds payable from and secured, in whole or in part, by:</p>

<p>(1) Income and revenues derived from the housing project or projects financed from the proceeds of bonds;</p>

<p>(2) Receipts derived from any grant from the federal government made in aid of a housing project or projects financed from the proceeds of bonds;</p>

<p>(3) Income and revenues derived from a particular designated housing project or projects whether or not financed, in whole or in part, from the proceeds of bonds;</p>

<p>(4) Receipts derived from any payment for &ldquo;eligible loans&rdquo;, &ldquo;eligible improvement loans&rdquo;, or &ldquo;eligible project loans&rdquo;, as the terms are defined in subpart B, or any other agreement or agreements entered into for a &ldquo;housing loan program&rdquo;, as the term is defined in subpart B or D, or any other loan program administered by the corporation and financed from the proceeds of bonds;</p>

<p>(5) Receipts derived from loans to mortgage lenders or from the payment on account of principal of or interest on loans purchased from mortgage lenders, as provided in subpart B which loans to mortgage lenders or loans purchased are financed from the proceeds of bonds;</p>

<p>(6) Moneys in any funds or accounts established in connection with the issuance of bonds, and any earnings thereon;</p>

<p>(7) Proceeds derived from any insurance;</p>

<p>(8) Income and revenues of the corporation generally; or</p>

<p>(9) Any combination of paragraphs (1) through (8).</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;income and revenues&rdquo; includes income and revenues derived from the sale of land or from both land and improvements thereon serviced from infrastructure financed from the proceeds of bonds as permitted by this subpart. The provisions of this subsection are in addition and supplemental to part III of chapter 39.</p>

<p>(e) Any of the bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any revenues or a mortgage of any housing project, other property of the corporation, the pledge or assignment of any loans or other agreements, or any note or other undertaking, obligation, or property held by or on behalf of the corporation to secure loans made from the proceeds of bonds for any &ldquo;housing loan program&rdquo;, as the term is defined in subpart B or D, or any other loan program administered by the corporation and financed from the proceeds of bonds.</p>

<p>(f) Any pledge made by the corporation shall create a perfected security interest in the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received by the corporation from and after the time that a financing statement with respect to the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received shall be filed with the bureau of conveyances. Upon the filing, the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received by the corporation shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be prior to the lien of all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the corporation, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. This section shall apply to any financing statement heretofore or hereafter filed with the bureau of conveyances with respect to any pledge made to secure revenue bonds issued under this part.</p>

<p>(g) Any housing project or projects authorized by, and undertaken pursuant to, this chapter shall constitute an &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; within the meaning of that term as defined and used in part III, chapter 39. Any loan program authorized by, and undertaken pursuant to, this chapter, including without limitation &ldquo;housing loan programs&rdquo; defined in and authorized by subparts B and D, shall constitute a &ldquo;loan program&rdquo; within the meaning of that term as defined and used in part III, chapter 39. The corporation shall constitute a &ldquo;department&rdquo; and the board shall constitute a &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; within the meaning of those terms as defined and used in part III, chapter 39.</p>

<p>(h) Neither the members of the board nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. [L 2006, c 180, pt of ยง4]</p>
