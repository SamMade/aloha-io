<p>(2) Arrange or enter into agreements with any governmental agency for the acquisition of property, options, or property rights or for the furnishing, installing, opening, or closing of streets, roads, alleys, sidewalks, or other places, or for the furnishing of property, services, parks, sewage, water, and other facilities in connection with housing projects, or for the changing of the map of a political subdivision or the planning, replanning, zoning, or rezoning of any part of a political subdivision;</p>

<p>(3) Procure insurance or guarantees from any governmental agency for the payment of any debts or parts thereof incurred by the corporation, including the power to pay premiums on any such insurance; and</p>

<p>(4) Agree to make payments to any state or county agency, if the agency is authorized to accept payments, as the corporation deems consistent with the maintenance of the character of housing projects or the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<p>(b) For the purpose of aiding and cooperating in the planning, construction, and operation of housing projects located within their respective territorial boundaries, any state or county agency, upon those terms, with or without consideration, as it determines, may:</p>

<p>(1) Dedicate, grant, sell, convey, or lease any of its property or grant easements, licenses, or any other rights or privileges therein to the corporation or to the federal government;</p>

<p>(2) To the extent that it is within the scope of the agency:</p>

<p>(A) Cause the services customarily provided by the agency to be rendered for the benefit of housing projects and the occupants thereof;</p>

<p>(B) Provide and maintain parks, sewage, water, lights, and other facilities adjacent to or in connection with housing projects;</p>

<p>(5) Do any and all things necessary or convenient to aid and cooperate in the planning, undertaking, and construction of those housing projects; and</p>

<p>(6) Enter into contracts with the corporation or the federal government for any period agreeing to exercise any of the powers conferred hereby or to take any other action in aid of those housing projects.</p>

<p>In connection with the exercise of this power, any political subdivision may incur the entire expense of any public improvements located within its territorial boundaries without assessment against abutting property owners.</p>

<p>For the purpose of aiding and cooperating in the planning, construction, and operation of housing projects, the department of land and natural resources, the Hawaiian homes commission, and any other agency of the State having power to manage or dispose of its public lands, with the approval of the governor and with or without consideration, may grant, sell, convey, or lease, for any period, any parts of those public lands, without limit as to area, to the corporation or to the federal government.</p>

<p>Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any gift, grant, sale, conveyance, lease, or agreement provided for in this section may be made by the state or county government without appraisal, public notice, advertisement, or public bidding.</p>

The advances or donations shall be made for the purpose of aiding or cooperating in the construction and operation of the housing project. The corporation, when it has money available therefor, shall reimburse the county for all advances made by way of a loan to it.
