      <p><strong>§201H-10 Cooperative agreements with other governmental agencies.</strong> (a) The corporation may:</p>

<p>(1) Obtain the aid and cooperation of governmental agencies in the planning, construction, and operation of housing projects and enter into agreements and arrangements as it deems advisable to obtain aid and cooperation;</p>

<p>(2) Arrange or enter into agreements with any governmental agency for the acquisition of property, options, or property rights or for the furnishing, installing, opening, or closing of streets, roads, alleys, sidewalks, or other places, or for the furnishing of property, services, parks, sewage, water, and other facilities in connection with housing projects, or for the changing of the map of a political subdivision or the planning, replanning, zoning, or rezoning of any part of a political subdivision;</p>

<p>(3) Procure insurance or guarantees from any governmental agency for the payment of any debts or parts thereof incurred by the corporation, including the power to pay premiums on any such insurance; and</p>

<p>(4) Agree to make payments to any state or county agency, if the agency is authorized to accept payments, as the corporation deems consistent with the maintenance of the character of housing projects or the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<p>(b) For the purpose of aiding and cooperating in the planning, construction, and operation of housing projects located within their respective territorial boundaries, any state or county agency, upon those terms, with or without consideration, as it determines, may:</p>

<p>(1) Dedicate, grant, sell, convey, or lease any of its property or grant easements, licenses, or any other rights or privileges therein to the corporation or to the federal government;</p>

<p>(2) To the extent that it is within the scope of the agency:</p>

<p>(A) Cause the services customarily provided by the agency to be rendered for the benefit of housing projects and the occupants thereof;</p>

<p>(B) Provide and maintain parks, sewage, water, lights, and other facilities adjacent to or in connection with housing projects;</p>

<p>&copy; Open, close, pave, install, or change the grade of streets, roads, roadways, alleys, sidewalks, or other related facilities; and</p>

<p>(D) Change the map of a political subdivision or plan, replan, zone, or rezone any part of a political subdivision;</p>

<p>(3) Enter into agreements with the corporation with respect to the exercise of their powers relating to the repair, closing, or demolition of unsafe, unsanitary, or unfit dwellings;</p>

<p>(4) Employ, notwithstanding any other law as to what constitutes legal investments, any available funds belonging to them or within their control, including funds derived from the sale or furnishing of property or facilities to the corporation, in the purchase of bonds or other obligations of the corporation; and exercise all the rights of any holder of the bonds or other obligations;</p>

<p>(5) Do any and all things necessary or convenient to aid and cooperate in the planning, undertaking, and construction of those housing projects; and</p>

<p>(6) Enter into contracts with the corporation or the federal government for any period agreeing to exercise any of the powers conferred hereby or to take any other action in aid of those housing projects.</p>

<p>In connection with the exercise of this power, any political subdivision may incur the entire expense of any public improvements located within its territorial boundaries without assessment against abutting property owners.</p>

<p>For the purpose of aiding and cooperating in the planning, construction, and operation of housing projects, the department of land and natural resources, the Hawaiian homes commission, and any other agency of the State having power to manage or dispose of its public lands, with the approval of the governor and with or without consideration, may grant, sell, convey, or lease, for any period, any parts of those public lands, without limit as to area, to the corporation or to the federal government.</p>

<p>Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any gift, grant, sale, conveyance, lease, or agreement provided for in this section may be made by the state or county government without appraisal, public notice, advertisement, or public bidding.</p>

<p>If at any time title to, or possession of, any housing project is held by any governmental agency authorized by law to engage in the development or administration of low-income housing or slum clearance projects, any agreement made under this chapter relating to the project shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by that governmental agency.</p>

<p>Insofar as this subsection is inconsistent with the provisions of any other law, this subsection shall be controlling.</p>

<p>&copy; Any county in which a housing project is located or is about to be located may make donations or advances to the corporation in sums as the county in its discretion may determine. The advances or donations shall be made for the purpose of aiding or cooperating in the construction and operation of the housing project. The corporation, when it has money available therefor, shall reimburse the county for all advances made by way of a loan to it.
