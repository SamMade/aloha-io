The corporation may designate any portions of the development for commercial, industrial, or other use and shall have all the powers granted under this chapter with respect thereto, including the power to bypass statutes, ordinances, charter provisions, and rules of any government agency pursuant to section 201H-38. For this purpose, the corporation may use any of the funds authorized under this chapter. (b) The corporation shall adopt rules that shall provide the manner in which the uses of properties shall be designated, and shall provide that any commercial, industrial, or other properties so developed shall be sold or leased at cost or at economic rents or sales prices. The net proceeds of all such sales or leases, less costs to the corporation, shall be deposited in the dwelling unit revolving fund. The rules may also provide that during the first twenty years after its purchase, any commercial, industrial, or other property so developed and sold may be resold or assigned only to the corporation at the original purchase price plus the cost of any improvements made by the purchaser together with simple interest on all of the purchaser&amp;rsquo;s equity in the property at the rate of seven per cent a year.
