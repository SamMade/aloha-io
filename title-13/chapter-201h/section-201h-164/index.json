If the borrower defaults in the payment of any installment of principal or interest of the downpayment loan, the corporation or mortgage lender shall take all necessary action to collect the delinquent amounts and may take all actions generally allowed holders of mortgages, including the power to foreclose. Upon any foreclosure of the second mortgage, the corporation or mortgage lender on behalf of the corporation, may purchase the interest of the borrower in and to the residential property, take possession thereof and assume all of the obligations of the borrower under the first mortgage held by the private lender and any other liens having priority over the second mortgage that may then exist. On the acquisition of the borrower&amp;rsquo;s interest, the corporation, at its option, may pay in full the unpaid balance of the borrower&amp;rsquo;s obligation secured by the first mortgage and other prior liens; repair, renovate, modernize, or improve the residential property; and, with or without clearing the property of all prior mortgages and liens, sell, lease, or rent the property or use or dispose of the same in any manner authorized by law.
