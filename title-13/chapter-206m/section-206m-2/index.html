      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Establishment of the high technology development corporation; purpose</h2>
      <p><strong>§206M-2 Establishment of the high technology development corporation; purpose.</strong> (a) There is established the high technology development corporation, which shall be a public body corporate and politic and an instrumentality and agency of the State. The development corporation shall be placed within the department of business, economic development, and tourism for administrative purposes, pursuant to section 26-35.

<p>(4) Promoting and marketing Hawaii as a site for commercial high technology activity; and</p>

<p>(5) Providing advice on policy and planning for technology-based economic development.</p>

<p>(b) The governing body of the development corporation shall consist of a board of directors having eleven voting members. Seven of the members shall be appointed by the governor for staggered terms pursuant to section 26-34. Six of the appointed members shall be from the general public and selected on the basis of their knowledge, interest, and proven expertise in, but not limited to, one or more of the following fields: finance, commerce and trade, corporate management, marketing, economics, engineering, and telecommunications, and other high technology fields. The other appointed member shall be selected from the faculty of the University of Hawaii. All appointed members of the board shall continue in office until their respective successors have been appointed. The director of business, economic development, and tourism, the director of finance, an appointed member from the board of the Hawaii strategic development corporation, and an appointed member from the board of the natural energy laboratory of Hawaii authority, or their designated representatives, shall serve as ex officio voting members of the board. The director of business, economic development, and tourism shall serve as the chairperson until such time as a chairperson is elected by the board from the membership. The board shall elect such other officers as it deems necessary.</p>

<p>&copy; The members of the board appointed under subsection (b) shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the performance of their duties.</p>

<p>(d) The board shall appoint a chief executive officer, who shall serve at the pleasure of the board and shall be exempt from chapter 76. The board shall set the salary and duties of the executive officer.</p>

<p>(e) The board shall appoint a management advisory committee for each industrial park and related project or projects governed by the board. Each committee shall have five members, who shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. The members shall be drawn from fields of activity related to each industrial park and related project or projects. [L 1983, c 152, pt of §2; am L 1987, c 336, §7; am L 1989, c 274, §2; am L 1990, c 293, §8; am L 1991, c 288, §1; am L 2000, c 72, §§5, 6, c 253, §150, and c 297, §25]</p>

<p>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p>Cited, as a constitutional board and commission statute where members may serve as holdovers until their successors are &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;, without any reference to the successors being fully &ldquo;qualified&rdquo;; an &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; properly occurs under the interim appointments provision of article V, §6 of the state constitution. Att. Gen. Op. 16-3.</p>
