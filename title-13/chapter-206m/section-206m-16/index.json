(a) All revenues and receipts derived by the development corporation from any project or industrial park or under a project agreement or other agreement pertaining thereto shall be exempt from all state and county taxation. Any right, title, and interest of the development corporation in any project or industrial park shall also be exempt from all state and county taxation. Except as otherwise provided by law, the interest of a qualified person or other user of a project or industrial park under a project agreement or other agreements related to a project or industrial park shall not be exempt from taxation to a greater extent than it would be if the costs of the project or industrial park were directly financed by the qualified person or user. (b) The development corporation shall not be subject to any requirement of law for competitive bidding for project agreements, construction contracts, lease and sublease agreements, or other contracts unless a project agreement with respect to a project or industrial park shall so require.
