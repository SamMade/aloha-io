<p>(1) To pay the development corporation during the period or term of the project agreement, exclusive of any renewal or extension thereof and whether or not the project or industrial park to which the project agreement relates is used or occupied by the qualified person, at the time or times and in the amount or amounts that will be at least sufficient:</p>

<p>(A) To pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all special purpose revenue bonds issued to finance the cost of the project, or an allocable portion of the special purpose revenue bonds issued to finance the industrial park, as the case may be, as and when the special purpose revenue bonds become due, including upon any required redemption thereof;</p>

<p>(e) Each qualified person with a project agreement with the development corporation shall allow the development corporation full access to the qualified person&rsquo;s financial records.

<p>(g) Each qualified person with a project agreement with the development corporation shall estimate the benefits derived from the use of the proceeds of special purpose revenue bonds.

<p>(h) To promote public understanding of the role played by special purpose revenue bonds in providing benefits to the general public, the development corporation shall take appropriate steps to ensure public access to and scrutiny of the estimates determined under subsection (g).</p>

<p>(i) The development corporation shall adopt rules under chapter 91 for the purposes of this section.</p>
