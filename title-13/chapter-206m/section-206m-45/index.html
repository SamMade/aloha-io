      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Special facility revenue bonds</h2>
      <p><strong>[ยง206M-45] Special facility revenue bonds.</strong> All special facility revenue bonds authorized to be issued under this part shall be issued pursuant to part III of chapter 39, except as follows:</p>

<p>(1) No revenue bonds shall be issued unless at the time of issuance, the development corporation has entered into a special facility lease with respect to the special facility for which the revenue bonds are to be issued;</p>

<p>(2) The revenue bonds shall be issued in the name of the development corporation and not in the name of the State;</p>

<p>(3) No further authorization of the legislature shall be required for the issuance of the special facility revenue bonds, but the approval of the governor shall be required for the issuance;</p>

<p>(4) The revenue bonds shall be payable solely from and secured solely by the revenues derived by the development corporation from the special facility for which they are issued;</p>

<p>(5) The final maturity date of the revenue bonds shall not be later than either the estimated life of the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued or the expiration of the initial term of the special facility lease;</p>

<p>(6) If deemed necessary or advisable by the development corporation, or to permit the obligations of the other party to the special facility lease to be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the development corporation, with the approval of the director of finance, may appoint a national or state bank within or without the State to serve as trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds and may enter into a trust indenture or trust agreement with the trustee. The trustee may be authorized by the development corporation to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued and to apply the revenues to the payment of the principal and interest on the revenue bonds. In the event that any trustee shall be appointed, any trust indenture or trust agreement entered into by the development corporation with the trustee may contain the covenants and provisions authorized by part III of chapter 39 to be inserted in a resolution adopted or certificate issued, as though the words &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; or &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; as used in that part read &ldquo;trust indenture or trust agreement&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The covenants and provisions shall not be required to be included in the resolution or certificate authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds if included in the trust indenture or trust agreement. Any resolution or certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement adopted, issued, or entered into by the development corporation pursuant to this part may also contain any provisions required for the qualification thereof under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The development corporation may pledge and assign to the trustee the special facility lease and the rights of the development corporation including the revenues thereunder;</p>

<p>(7) If the development corporation, with the approval of the director of finance, shall have appointed or shall appoint a trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds, then notwithstanding the provisions of section 39-68, the director of finance may elect not to serve as fiscal agent for the payment of the principal and interest, and for the purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption of the revenue bonds, or may elect to limit the functions the director of finance shall perform as the fiscal agent. The development corporation, with the approval of the director of finance, may appoint the trustee to serve as the fiscal agent, and may authorize and empower the trustee to perform the functions with respect to payment, purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, that the development corporation may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient, including, without limitation, the holding of the revenue bonds and coupons, if any, that have been paid and the supervising and conducting of the destruction thereof in accordance with sections 40-10 and 40-11. Nothing in this paragraph shall be a limitation upon or construed as a limitation upon the powers granted in paragraph (6) to the development corporation with the approval of the director of finance to appoint the trustee, or granted in sections 36-3, 39-13, and 39-68 to the director of finance to appoint the trustee or others, as fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars for the revenue bonds or to authorize and empower the fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars to perform the functions referred to in paragraph (6) and sections 36-3, 39-13, and 39-68, it being the intent of this paragraph to confirm that the director of finance may elect not to serve as fiscal agent for the revenue bonds or may elect to limit the functions the director of finance shall perform as the fiscal agent, that the director of finance may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient;</p>

<p>(8) The development corporation may sell the revenue bonds either at public or private sale;</p>

<p>(9) If no trustee is appointed to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued, the revenues shall be held in a separate account in the treasury of the State, separate and apart from the high technology special fund, to be applied solely to the carrying out of the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement authorizing or securing the revenue bonds;</p>

<p>(10) If the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement provides that no revenue bonds issued thereunder shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless certified or authenticated by the trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds, the signatures of the officers of the State upon the bonds required by section 39-56 may be facsimiles of their signatures;</p>

<p>(11) Proceeds of the revenue bonds may be used and applied by the development corporation to reimburse the other party to the special facility lease for all preliminary costs and expenses, including architectural and legal costs; and</p>

<p>(12) If the special facility lease requires the other party to operate, maintain, and repair the special facility that is the subject of the lease, at the other party&rsquo;s expense, the requirement shall constitute compliance by the development corporation with section 39-61(a)(2), and none of the revenues derived by the development corporation from the special facility shall be required to be applied to the purposes of section 39-62(2). Sections 39-62(4), 39-62(5), and 39-62(6) shall not apply to the revenues derived from a special facility lease. [L 2000, c 72, pt of ยง1]</p>
