      <p><strong>§201B-2</strong> <strong>Hawaii tourism authority; establishment; board; president and chief executive officer.</strong> (a) There is established the Hawaii tourism authority, which shall be a body corporate and a public instrumentality of the State, for the purpose of implementing this chapter. The authority shall be placed within the department of business, economic development, and tourism for administrative purposes only.</p>

<p>(b) The authority shall be headed by a policy-making board of directors that shall consist of twelve members; provided that:</p>

<p>(1) The members shall be appointed by the governor as provided in section 26-34, except as provided by this section;</p>

<p>(2) The members shall include at least one representative each from the city and county of Honolulu and the counties of Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui;</p>

<p>(3) Three members shall be appointed by the governor from a list of three names submitted for each appointment by the president of the senate, and three members shall be appointed by the governor from a list of three names submitted for each appointment by the speaker of the house of representatives; provided that if fewer than three names are submitted for each appointment, the governor may disregard the list;</p>

<p>(4) At least six members shall have knowledge, experience, and expertise in the area of accommodations, transportation, retail, entertainment, or attractions, and at least one member appointed by the governor shall have knowledge, experience, and expertise in the area of Hawaiian cultural practices; provided that no more than three members shall represent, be employed by, or be under contract to any sector of the industry represented on the board;</p>

<p>(5) The governor shall make appointments to ensure the fulfillment of all requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4); provided that upon the occurrence of a vacancy subject to paragraph (3), the governor shall notify the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives of any unfulfilled requirements pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4), and the president of the senate or the speaker of the house of representatives, as appropriate, shall submit nominees who fulfill those requirements; and</p>

<p>(6) No person who has served as a member of the board of directors of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau shall be eligible to sit as a member of the board of directors of the Hawaii tourism authority until at least two years have expired between the person&rsquo;s termination from service on the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau board and the person&rsquo;s appointment to the authority&rsquo;s board of directors.</p>

<p>&copy; Members shall be appointed by the governor for terms of four years; provided that membership on the board shall not exceed eight consecutive years; provided further that each member shall hold office until the member&rsquo;s successor is appointed and qualified.</p>

<p>(d) The board shall elect a chairperson from among the members.</p>

<p>(e) Seven members shall constitute a quorum and a minimum of seven affirmative votes shall be necessary for all actions by the authority. The members shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for expenses, including traveling expenses, necessary for the performance of their duties.</p>

<p>(f) The board shall appoint one person to serve as president and chief executive officer, exempt from chapters 76 and 88 who shall oversee the authority staff; provided that the compensation package, including salary, shall not exceed fifteen per cent of the 3.5 per cent authorized for administrative expenses under section 201B-11&copy;; and provided further that the compensation package shall not include private sector moneys or other contributions. The board shall set the president and chief executive officer&rsquo;s duties, responsibilities, holidays, vacations, leaves, hours of work, and working conditions.
