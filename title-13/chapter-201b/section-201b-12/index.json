(a) All revenues and receipts derived by the authority from any project or a project agreement or other agreement pertaining thereto shall be exempt from all state taxation. Any right, title, and interest of the authority in any project shall also be exempt from all state taxation. Except as otherwise provided by law, the interest of a qualified person or other user of a project or a project agreement or other agreements related to a project shall not be exempt from taxation to a greater extent than it would be if the costs of the project were directly financed by the qualified person or user. (b) The authority shall not be subject to chapter 103D and any and all other requirements of law for competitive bidding for project agreements, construction contracts, lease and sublease agreements, or other contracts unless a project agreement with respect to a project otherwise shall require. [L 1998, c 156, pt of ยง2] "
