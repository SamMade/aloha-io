(b) A disclaimer of an interest in property is barred if any of the following events occur before the disclaimer becomes effective: (1) The disclaimant accepts the interest sought to be disclaimed; (2) The disclaimant voluntarily assigns, conveys, encumbers, pledges, or transfers the interest sought to be disclaimed or contracts to do so; or (3) A judicial sale of the interest sought to be disclaimed occurs. &amp;copy; A disclaimer, in whole or part, of the future exercise of a power held in a fiduciary capacity is not barred by its previous exercise. (d) A disclaimer, in whole or part, of the future exercise of a power not held in a fiduciary capacity is not barred by its previous exercise unless the power is exercisable in favor of the disclaimant. (e) A disclaimer is barred or limited if so provided by law other than this chapter. (f) A disclaimer of a power over property which is barred by this section is ineffective.
