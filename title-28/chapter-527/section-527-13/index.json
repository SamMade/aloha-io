(b) Pursuant to the filing requirements of chapter 501 or the recording provisions of [chapter] 502, as applicable, a beneficiary shall take the subject property subject to all conveyances, encumbrances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, liens, and other interests to which the subject property is subject at the transferor&amp;rsquo;s death. For purposes of this subsection and the filing provisions of chapter 501 or the recording provisions of chapter 502, the filing or recording of the transfer on death deed is deemed to have occurred at the transferor&amp;rsquo;s death. &amp;copy; If a transferor is a joint owner and is survived by one or more other joint owners, the subject property shall belong to the surviving joint owner or owners with the right of survivorship and the transfer on death deed shall have no effect. If a transferor is a joint owner and is the last surviving joint owner, the transfer on death deed shall be effective. (d) A transfer on death deed transfers the subject property without covenant or warranty of title even if the transfer on death deed contains a contrary provision. [L 2011, c 173, pt of ยง1] "
