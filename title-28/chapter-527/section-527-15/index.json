(b) If more than one property is transferred by one or more transfer on death deeds, the liability under subsection (a) shall be apportioned among the subject properties in proportion to their respective net values at the time of the transferor&amp;rsquo;s death. &amp;copy; A proceeding to enforce liability under this section shall be commenced not later than eighteen months after the transferor&amp;rsquo;s death.
