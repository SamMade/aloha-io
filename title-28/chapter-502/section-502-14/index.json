When an instrument, by which one person by authority of law transfers or conveys the real estate of another person, is left for record, the registrar shall enter in the registrar&amp;rsquo;s entry book and grantor index both the name of the person making the transfer and conveyance and that of the person whose estate has been so transferred or conveyed, if the latter name appears in the instrument. When a return of a commissioner appointed to make partition of real estate is left for record, the registrar shall enter in the entry book, and in both the grantor and grantee indexes, the names of all persons whose estates plainly appear to be affected by the return.
