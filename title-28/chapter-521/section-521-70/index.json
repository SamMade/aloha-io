(b) The landlord may, during any extended absence of the tenant, enter the dwelling unit as reasonably necessary for purposes of inspection, maintenance, and safe-keeping or for the purposes permitted by section 521-53(a). &amp;copy; Unless otherwise provided in the rental agreement, use of the dwelling unit by the tenant for any other purpose than as the tenant&amp;rsquo;s abode, or nonuse of the dwelling unit, constitutes a breach of the tenant&amp;rsquo;s obligations under section 521-52 and entitles the landlord to proceed as provided in section 521-72.
