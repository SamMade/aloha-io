<p>(2) Use any promotional device, including but not limited to entertainment, prizes, gifts, food and drinks, games, transportation, luaus, ocean recreational activities, land recreational activities, aerial recreational activities, or tours, or other inducements, or make any offer thereof, without fully disclosing orally and as provided in paragraph (3) that the device is being used or offered for the purpose of soliciting sales of time share units or interests;</p>

<p>(3) Offer a prospective purchaser a prize or gift as part of any time share advertising or sales promotion plan, if in order to claim the prize, the prospective purchaser must attend and complete a sales presentation, unless written disclosure is furnished to the prospective purchaser at the time the prospective purchaser is notified of the prize or gift; provided that the written disclosure is written or printed in a size equal to at least ten-point bold type and contains all of the following:</p>

<p>(A) A full description of the exact prize or gift won by the prospective purchaser including its cash value;</p>

<p>(B) All material terms and conditions attached to the prize or gift;</p>

<p>(7) Include, in any contract or reservation agreement, provisions purporting to waive any right or benefit provided for purchasers pursuant to this chapter;</p>

<p>(8) Receive from any prospective purchaser any money, property (including but not limited to a credit card), or other valuable consideration prior to signing a contract or reservation agreement for the purchase of a time share plan or unit; provided that this paragraph shall not apply to sums paid by a purchaser or prospective purchaser for a tourist activity or for any other product or service offered to induce attendance at a time share sales presentation;</p>

<p>(9) Make any agreement or contract with a purchaser before delivering, furnishing, or tendering to that prospective purchaser any promised promotional device or other instrument; provided that nothing herein or in the rules adopted by the director shall require that any promotional device or instrument be delivered, furnished, or tendered to the prospective purchaser prior to making a sales presentation;</p>

<p>(10) Distribute any promotional or disclosure material separately if the material was filed in a consolidated form;</p>

<p>(11) Use any unregistered time share booth, or fail to display at all times a conspicuous, clear, and unobstructed sign of a permanent nature:</p>

<p>Any violation of this section shall also constitute an unlawful or deceptive practice within the meaning of section 480-2; provided that in addition violations of section 514E-31 or of paragraph (11) shall result in a fine of not less than $50 for each separate offense for a maximum aggregate amount of $500.
