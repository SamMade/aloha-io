An application may include two or more parcels of land in which the applicant claims the same interests; provided that all parcels must be within the same district, as such districts are defined by chapter 4, except that the districts of North Kona and South Kona, referred to in subparagraphs (G) and (H) of section 4-1(1), shall be deemed one district for this purpose. Two or more parcels shall not be included in one application regardless of where they are situated, unless the claim of the applicant is of the same interest in each parcel included in the application. Coapplicants, whether their claims are of equal or unequal interest in the lands sought to be registered, shall not include more than one parcel in one application, unless the interest claimed by each applicant is uniform and of the same quantum of estate in every parcel sought to be included in the one application.
