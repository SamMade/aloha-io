If the applicant is not a resident of the State, the applicant shall file with the applicant&amp;rsquo;s application a paper appointing an agent residing in the State, giving the agent&amp;rsquo;s name in full and post office address, and shall therein agree that the service of any legal process in proceedings under or growing out of the application is of the same legal effect when made on the agent, as if made on the applicant within the State. If the agent dies, or removes from the State, the applicant shall at once make another appointment. If the applicant fails to do so the court may dismiss the application.
