<p>(8) Any notice of time share plan, any declaration of annexation or deannexation, any amendments thereto, and any cancellation or extinguishment thereof.</p>

<p>(f) The execution or joinder of the lessees of the leasehold time share interests shall not be required for the registration or notation of instruments which must be registered and noted pursuant to subsection (e); provided, however, an instrument amending, canceling, or extinguishing an apartment lease shall not be registered unless such instrument is:</p>

In the event that the affidavit is incorrect and the title insurer or underwritten title company acted with gross negligence or in bad faith in making the affidavit, the title insurer or underwritten title company shall be liable to the owners of the leasehold time share interests for treble damages and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>

<p>This section shall not alter the rights of the parties to any such instrument. [L 1998, c 219, pt of ยง1; am L 2008, c 28, ยง30; am L 2012, c 182, ยง7]</p>
