The documents that you are signing may have legal consequences, and you may have rights under Hawaii law. By signing below, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this.&amp;rdquo; (b) If the person whose signature is witnessed or acknowledged by the commissioner does not speak English, a translation of the notice required by subsection (a) shall be provided to the person in the predominant language spoken in the country in which the execution or acknowledgment takes place; provided that: (1) The content of the notice may be varied as necessary to convey the intended concepts in the other language; and (2) Neither the commissioner nor any other person shall be liable for errors in translation of the notice required by subsection (a) so long as a good faith effort to accurately translate the notice was made. &amp;copy; A commissioner of deeds shall retain, for three calendar years from the date upon which the notice was executed, the original executed notice or a copy made by any means capable of providing an accurate reproduction of the executed notice. (d) Failure to provide the notice required by subsection (a) shall subject the commissioner of deeds to a penalty in an amount to be established by the lieutenant governor by rule adopted pursuant to chapter 91 but shall not render any agreement void or voidable, nor shall it constitute a defense to any action to enforce the agreement or any action for breach of the agreement by any party to the agreement.
