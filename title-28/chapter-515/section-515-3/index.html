      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Discriminatory practices</h2>
      <p><strong>§515-3 Discriminatory practices.</strong> It is a discriminatory practice for an owner or any other person engaging in a real estate transaction, or for a real estate broker or salesperson, because of race, sex, including gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, color, religion, marital status, familial status, ancestry, disability, age, or human immunodeficiency virus infection:</p>

<p>(1) To refuse to engage in a real estate transaction with a person;</p>

<p>(2) To discriminate against a person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of a real estate transaction or in the furnishing of facilities or services in connection with a real estate transaction;</p>

<p>(3) To refuse to receive or to fail to transmit a bona fide offer to engage in a real estate transaction from a person;</p>

<p>(4) To refuse to negotiate for a real estate transaction with a person;</p>

<p>(5) To represent to a person that real property is not available for inspection, sale, rental, or lease when in fact it is available, or to fail to bring a property listing to the person&rsquo;s attention, or to refuse to permit the person to inspect real property, or to steer a person seeking to engage in a real estate transaction;</p>

<p>(6) To offer, solicit, accept, use, or retain a listing of real property with the understanding that a person may be discriminated against in a real estate transaction or in the furnishing of facilities or services in connection with a real estate transaction;</p>

<p>[(7)] To solicit or require as a condition of engaging in a real estate transaction that the buyer, renter, or lessee be tested for human immunodeficiency virus infection, the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;</p>

<p>[(8)] To refuse to permit, at the expense of a person with a disability, reasonable modifications to existing premises occupied or to be occupied by the person if modifications may be necessary to afford the person full enjoyment of the premises; provided that a real estate broker or salesperson, where it is reasonable to do so, may condition permission for a modification on the person agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted;</p>

<p>[(9)] To refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when the accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy a housing accommodation; provided that if reasonable accommodations include the use of an animal, reasonable restrictions may be imposed;</p>

<p>[(10)] In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily housing accommodations for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, to fail to design and construct housing accommodations in such a manner that:</p>

<p>(A) The housing accommodations have at least one accessible entrance, unless it is impractical to do so because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of the site; and</p>

<p>(B) With respect to housing accommodations with an accessible building entrance:</p>

<p>(i) The public use and common use portions of the housing accommodations are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities;</p>

<p>(ii) Doors allow passage by persons in wheelchairs; and</p>

<p>(iii) All premises within covered multifamily housing accommodations contain an accessible route into and through the housing accommodations; light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls are in accessible locations; reinforcements in the bathroom walls allow installation of grab bars; and kitchens and bathrooms are accessible by wheelchair; or</p>

<p>[(11)] To discriminate against or deny a person access to, or membership or participation in any multiple listing service, real estate broker&rsquo;s organization, or other service, organization, or facility involved either directly or indirectly in real estate transactions, or to discriminate against any person in the terms or conditions of access, membership, or participation.

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>While this section does not explicitly mention emotional support animals, it invites the possibility of their acceptance within the broad limitation of &ldquo;use of an animal&rdquo;. Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion denied to the extent that it sought summary judgment declaring that before it was required to grant a waiver of its no pet policy pursuant to a reasonable accommodation request, it could require that the animal have received some individual training. 892 F. Supp. 2d 1268 (2012).</p>
