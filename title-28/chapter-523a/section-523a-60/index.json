  "context": "[ยง523A-60] Answer; disposition of funds on deposit; dismissal without prejudice. Any person, whether or not named in the petition, may within fifteen days but not more than sixty days after the date of the first publication of the notice respond to the petition by answer describing the property, asserting an interest as owner or successor, and declaring an intention to claim the same from the United States under the laws of the United States. Such answer shall not be filed unless accompanied by the sum of $50, and no other answer or response shall be filed by or on behalf of a claimant. The court shall strike from the petition and dismiss from the proceeding all property described in an answer. Such dismissal shall be without prejudice to a subsequent petition should it appear that the claimant is not entitled to the property, and the interest asserted in said answer shall not thereafter be asserted against the State. The funds deposited with any answer shall be transmitted by the court to the director and shall be received for deposit in the general fund as total reimbursement for costs and services expended on behalf of the claimant. [L 1988, c 93, pt of ยง2] "
