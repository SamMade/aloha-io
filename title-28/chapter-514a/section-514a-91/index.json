In a voluntary conveyance the grantee of an apartment is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the latter for the grantor&amp;rsquo;s share of the common expenses up to the time of the grant or conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee&amp;rsquo;s right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee therefor. However, any such grantor or grantee is entitled to a statement from the manager or board of directors setting forth the amount of the unpaid assessments against the grantor, and except as to the amount of subsequently dishonored checks mentioned in such statement as having been received within the thirty-day period immediately preceding the date of such statement, the grantee is not liable for, nor is the apartment conveyed subject to a lien for, any unpaid assessments against the grantor in excess of the amount therein set forth.
