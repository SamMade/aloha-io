(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 514A-15, commercial apartments in mixed-use projects containing apartments for both residential and commercial use shall have a separate meter, or calculations shall be made, or both, to determine the use by the commercial apartments of utilities, including electricity, water, gas, fuel, oil, sewerage, and drainage and the cost of the utilities shall be paid by the owners of the commercial units; provided that the apportionment of the charges among owners of commercial apartments shall be done in a fair and equitable manner as set forth in the declaration or bylaws. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this chapter or in a project&amp;rsquo;s declaration or bylaws of an association of apartment owners, the board of directors may authorize the installation of separate meters to determine the use by each of the residential and commercial apartments of utilities, including electricity, water, gas, fuel, oil, sewerage, and drainage; provided that the cost of installing the meters shall be paid by the association. (b) Notwithstanding any approval requirements and spending limits contained in the declaration or bylaws of an association of apartment owners, the board of directors of any association of apartment owners may authorize the installation of meters to determine the use by each residential or commercial apartment of utilities, including electricity, water, gas, fuel, oil, sewerage, and drainage; provided that the cost of installing the meters shall be paid by the association. The cost of metered utilities shall be paid by the owners of each apartment based on actual consumption and may be collected in the same manner as common expense assessments. Owners&amp;rsquo; maintenance fees shall be adjusted as necessary to avoid any duplication of charges to these owners for the cost of metered utilities.
