An amendment to the declaration made pursuant to the exercise of those reserved rights shall require only the consent or approval, if any, specified in the reservation; and (13) A declaration, subject to the penalties set forth in section 514B-69(b), that the condominium property regime is in compliance with all zoning and building ordinances and codes, and all other permitting requirements pursuant to section 514B-5 and chapter 205, including section 205-4.6 where applicable.
