This rescission right shall not apply, however, in the event of any additions, deletions, modifications and reservations including, without limitation, the merger or addition or phasing of a project, made pursuant to the terms of the declaration. (b) Upon delivery to a purchaser of a description of the material change on a form prescribed by the commission, the purchaser may waive the purchaser&amp;rsquo;s rescission right provided in subsection (a) by: (1) Checking the waiver box on the option to rescind sales contract instrument, signing it, and delivering it to the seller; (2) Letting the thirty-day rescission period expire without taking any action to rescind; or (3) Closing the purchase of the unit before the thirty-day rescission period expires. &amp;copy; In order to be valid, a rescission form must be signed by all purchasers of the affected unit, and postmarked no later than midnight of the thirtieth calendar day after the date that the purchasers received the rescission form from the seller.
