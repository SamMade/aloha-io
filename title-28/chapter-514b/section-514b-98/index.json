(a) The developer may go to sale using either a chronological system or a lottery system at any time after issuance of an effective date for a developer&amp;rsquo;s public report. (b) For a thirty-day period following the initial date of sale of units in a condominium project, at least fifty per cent of the units being sold shall be offered for sale only to prospective owner-occupants; provided that notwithstanding this subpart, in the case of a project that includes one or more existing structures being converted to condominium status, each residential unit contained in the project first shall be offered for sale to any individual occupying the unit immediately prior to the conversion and who submits an owner-occupant affidavit and an earnest money deposit in a reasonable amount designated by the developer. &amp;copy; Each contract for the purchase of a residential unit by an owner-occupant may be conditioned upon the purchaser obtaining adequate financing, or a commitment for adequate financing. If the sales contract is canceled, the developer shall re-offer the residential unit first to prospective owner-occupants on the back-up reservation list described in section 514B-96.5, in the order in which the names appear on the reservation list; provided that the prospective owner-occupant shall not have already executed a sales contract or reservation for a residential unit in the project.
