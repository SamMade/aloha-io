A third person shall not be bound to inquire whether the association has power to act as trustee or is properly exercising trust powers. A third person, without actual knowledge that the association is exceeding or improperly exercising its powers, shall be fully protected in dealing with the association as if it possessed and properly exercised the powers it purports to exercise. A third person shall not be bound to assure the proper application of trust assets paid or delivered to the association in its capacity as trustee. [L 2004, c 164, pt of ยง2] "
