The declaration may limit the board&rsquo;s ability to approve or condition a proposed addition or alteration; provided that the board shall always have the right to disapprove a proposed addition or alteration that the board reasonably determines could jeopardize the soundness or safety of the property, impair any easement, or interfere with or deprive any nonconsenting owner of the use or enjoyment of any part of the property.</p>

<p>(B) The installation of antennas, conduits, chases, cables, wires, and other television signal distribution and telecommunications equipment upon the common elements by the board shall not be deemed to alter, impair, or diminish the common interest, common elements, and easements appurtenant to each unit, or to be a structural alteration or addition to any building constituting a material change in the plans of the project filed in accordance with sections 514B-33 and 514B-34; provided that no installation shall directly affect any nonconsenting unit owner;</p>

<p>(2) Regarding the abandonment of telecommunications equipment:</p>

<p>(3) Regarding the installation of solar energy devices and wind energy devices:</p>

<p>(B) The installation of solar energy devices and wind energy devices on the common elements of the project by the board shall not be deemed to alter, impair, or diminish the common interest, common elements, or easements appurtenant to each unit or to be a structural alteration or addition to any building constituting a material change in the plans of the project filed in accordance with sections 514B-33 and 514B-34; provided that the installation does not directly affect any nonconsenting unit owner.</p>
