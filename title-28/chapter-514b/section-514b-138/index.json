(d) If a unit owner fails to follow requirements imposed by the board pursuant to this section, the association, after reasonable notice, may enter the unit to perform the requirements with regard to such high-risk components at the sole cost and expense of the unit owner, which costs and expenses shall be a lien on the unit as provided in section 514B-146.
