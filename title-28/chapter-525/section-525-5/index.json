(a) Except as extended by subsection (b), this chapter applies to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment that is created on or after June 18, 1992. For the purposes of this section, a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by the exercise of a power of appointment is created when the power is irrevocably exercised or when a revocable exercise becomes irrevocable. (b) If a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment was created before June 18, 1992 and is determined in a judicial proceeding, commenced on or after June 18, 1992, to violate this State&amp;rsquo;s common law rule against perpetuities as that rule existed before June 18, 1992, a court upon the petition of an interested person may reform the disposition in the manner that most closely approximates the transferor&amp;rsquo;s manifested plan of distribution and is within the limits of the rule against perpetuities applicable when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment was created. [L 1992, c 262, pt of ยง2] Revision Note &amp;ldquo;June 18, 1992&amp;rdquo; substituted for &amp;ldquo;the effective date of this chapter&amp;rdquo;. "
