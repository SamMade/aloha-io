If any part, section, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter, or its application to any person or transaction or other circumstances, is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, the remaining parts, sections, sentences, clauses, and phrases of this chapter, or the application of this chapter to other persons or transactions or circumstances, shall not be affected. The legislature hereby declares that it would have passed this chapter and each part, section, clause, or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more parts, sections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this chapter, or its application to any person or transaction or other circumstance, be declared unconstitutional or invalid. [L 1975, c 184, §2(21)] Case Notes Since Hawaii Land Reform Act contains comprehensive severability clause, unless statute stands or falls as a whole, specific invalid provisions may be separated out. 471 F. Supp. 871. "
