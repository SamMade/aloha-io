If bonds issued pursuant to this part are issued bearing interest at a rate or rates which vary from time to time and with a right of holders to tender the bonds for purchase, the director of finance, with the approval of the governor, may contract for the support facility or facilities and remarketing arrangements as are required to market the bonds to the greatest advantage of the State upon such terms and conditions as the director of finance deems necessary and proper. The director of finance may enter into contracts or agreements with the entity or entities providing a support facility; provided that any contract or agreement shall provide, in essence, that any amount due and owing by the State under the contract or agreement on an annual basis shall be subject to annual appropriation by the State and any obligation issued or arising pursuant to the terms of such contract or agreement in the form of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness shall only arise at such time as either: (1) Moneys or securities have been irrevocably set aside for the full payment of a like principal amount of bonds issued pursuant to this part; or (2) A like principal amount of the issue or series of bonds to which the support facility relates are held in escrow by the entity or entities providing the support facility.
