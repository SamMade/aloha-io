      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">State debt limit statement</h2>
      <p><strong>§39-92 State debt limit statement.</strong> (a) The director of finance shall annually as of July 1 of each fiscal year and following each issuance of general obligation bonds of the State ascertain and set forth in a table or other summary a statement evidencing the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds. In preparing the statements required by this section, the director of finance may rely on the statement of total outstanding indebtedness of the State and the exclusions therefrom prepared pursuant to section 39-93 to the extent such statement is concurred to by the attorney general and the comptroller. The statement shall include the following:</p>

<p>(1) The total principal and interest payable in the current fiscal year and in each future fiscal year on all outstanding general obligation indebtedness of the State including outstanding general obligation bonds, reimbursable general obligation bonds, and any other outstanding general obligation bonds. Principal and interest on bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness under which the State incurs a contingent liability as a guarantor need not be included, but only to the extent the principal amount of such bonds does not exceed seven per cent of the principal amount of outstanding general obligation bonds not otherwise excluded under section 13 of Article VII of the Constitution; provided that the State shall have established and is maintaining a reserve in an amount in reasonable proportion to the outstanding loans guaranteed by the State pursuant to law.</p>

<p>(2) The total principal and interest payable in the current fiscal year and in each future fiscal year on all outstanding general obligation indebtedness of the State which may be excluded under section 13 of Article VII of the Constitution in determining the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds for the purposes of that section. There shall be itemized and shown the amounts which may be excluded under each of clauses 1 through 9 of section 13; in the case of reimbursable general obligation bonds, the undertaking, improvement, system, or political subdivision for which such bonds are issued, and, except as to such bonds issued for a political subdivision, the revenues, user taxes, or both, from which the reimbursement to the general fund for the payment of the principal and interest of such bonds is to be made.</p>

<p>(3) The total principal and interest payable in the current fiscal year and in each future fiscal year on all outstanding general obligation indebtedness which may not be excluded in determining the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds for the purposes of section 13 of Article VII of the Constitution.</p>

<p>(4) The net general fund revenues for each of the three preceding fiscal years, the average of such net general fund revenues and, until June 30, 1982, the figure which is twenty per cent of such average; and thereafter, the figure which is eighteen and one-half per cent of such average.</p>

<p>The items required above to be set forth in the statement may be disclosed in such manner or arrangement as the director of finance may deem advisable, and need not be separately stated if the captions, headings, or groupings disclose the information required to be set forth.</p>

<p>(b) The director of finance shall also prepare and attach to the statement such supporting schedules as may be required to set forth in detail the bonds included in the itemizations required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section. The supporting schedules shall also set forth a finding and determination of the net general fund revenues for each of the preceding three fiscal years by setting forth the following for each such preceding fiscal year:</p>

<p>(1) The total of the moneys paid into the general fund in such fiscal year;</p>

<p>(2) The total of the moneys paid into the general fund in such fiscal year received as grants from the federal government;</p>

<p>(3) The total of the moneys paid into the general fund in such fiscal year from revenues, or user taxes, or combination thereof derived from a public undertaking, improvement, or system, to the extent such payments into the general fund were made in reimbursement of the payment during such fiscal year from the general fund of the principal and interest of reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for such undertaking, improvement, or system which are to be excluded in determining the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds;</p>

<p>(4) The total of the moneys paid into the general fund in such fiscal year from the revenue of a political subdivision, to the extent such payments into the general fund were made in reimbursement of the payment during such fiscal year from the general fund of the principal and interest of reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for the political subdivision which are to be excluded in determining the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds;</p>

<p>(5) The difference obtained by subtracting from the total required to be set forth in the statement by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the totals required to be set forth in the statement by paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection, which difference shall constitute the net general fund revenues of the State for such preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p>&copy; If payments from the general fund were made in the immediately preceding fiscal year for interest or principal of reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for an undertaking, improvement, or system, the supporting schedules relating to such undertaking, improvement, or system shall also set forth in brief and summary form the following with respect to such undertaking, improvement, or system:</p>

<p>(1) The revenues or user taxes, or both, as follows:</p>

<p>(A) The amount of surplus revenues or surplus user taxes, or both, derived in prior fiscal years from or with respect to the undertaking, improvement, or system which are carried forward in the fiscal year, to the extent such surplus revenues or surplus user taxes, or both, are available in the fiscal year for the payment of costs for operation, maintenance, and repair of the undertaking, improvement, or system, the payment of interest and principal due on revenue bonds issued for the undertaking, improvement, or system, and payment into the general fund in reimbursement of the payment from the general fund of the principal and interest on reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for such undertaking, improvement, or system;</p>

<p>(B) The amount of the revenues or user taxes, or both, derived in the fiscal year from or with respect to the undertaking, improvement, or system; and</p>

<p>&copy; The total of (A) and (B) of this paragraph;</p>

<p>(2) The total of the costs of operation, maintenance, and repair of the undertaking, improvement, or system during the fiscal year;</p>

<p>(3) The total of payments made during the fiscal year of interest and principal on revenue bonds issued for the undertaking, improvement, or system;</p>

<p>(4) The total of the payments made during the fiscal year from the general fund for interest and principal on reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for such undertaking, improvement, or system;</p>

<p>(5) The amount paid into the general fund during the fiscal year from the total net revenues or net user tax receipts, or both, set forth in the schedule pursuant to paragraph (1)&copy; of this subsection of the undertaking, improvement, or system; and</p>

<p>(6) The percentage obtained by dividing the figure required to be set forth in the schedule by paragraph (4) of this subsection into the figure required to be set forth by paragraph (5) of this subsection which percentage shall constitute the percentage of the reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for the undertaking, improvement, or system which may be excluded under clause 6 of section 13 of Article VII of the Constitution when determining the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds.</p>

<p>(d) The director of finance shall also prepare and attach to the statement such supporting schedules as may be necessary to be set forth in such a manner or arrangement as the director of finance may deem advisable the following:</p>

<p>(1) The principal amount of bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness under which the State incurs a contingent liability as a guarantor which may be excluded under clause 8 of section 13 of Article VII of the Constitution when determining the power of the State to issue general obligation bonds;</p>

<p>(2) The total principal amount of all outstanding general obligation indebtedness of the State including general obligation bonds, reimbursable general obligation bonds, and any other outstanding general obligation bonds;</p>

<p>(3) The total principal amount of outstanding general obligation indebtedness of the State which may be excluded under section 13 of Article VII of the Constitution. There shall be itemized and shown the amounts which may be excluded under each of clauses 1 through 9 of section 13; in the case of reimbursable general obligation bonds, the undertaking, improvement, system, or political subdivision for which such bonds are issued. The principal amount of reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for an undertaking, improvement, or system for the purposes of this paragraph shall be the product of the respective percentages obtained in subsection &copy;(6) of this section and the total principal amount of outstanding reimbursable general obligation bonds issued for an undertaking, improvement, or system;</p>

<p>(4) The difference obtained by subtracting from the total required to be set forth in the statement by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the total required to be set forth in the statement by paragraph (3) of this subsection, which difference shall constitute the principal amount of outstanding general obligation bonds not otherwise excluded under clause 8 of section 13 of Article VII of the Constitution;</p>

<p>(5) The principal and interest and fraction thereof for the amount of bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness under which the State incurs a contingent liability as a guarantor obtained from paragraph (1) of this subsection which is in excess of seven per cent of the amount obtained in paragraph (4) of this subsection shall be included in the schedule set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>

<p>(e) Upon the preparation by the director of finance of any statement and supporting schedules required by this section, the director shall certify such statement and supporting schedules to the governor and the presiding officers of the legislature. The statement and schedules so certified shall be conclusive as to all items therein. The director of finance shall reproduce and deliver to the legislature a sufficient number of copies of such certified statements, so that a copy of each such statement may be distributed to each member of the legislature at the next regular session thereof. Only the statement itself shall be required to be reproduced, and the copies need not include any of the supporting schedules required by this section.</p>

<p>(f) Prior to the issuance of any general obligation bonds the director of finance shall prepare a finding to be set forth in such a manner as the director may deem advisable that such issuance shall not cause the debt limit of the State to be exceeded. [L 1979, c 57, pt of §10]</p>
