      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Sale of bonds</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง39-5</strong> <strong>Sale of bonds.</strong> (a) The director of finance may make such arrangements as may be necessary or proper for the sale of each issue of bonds or part thereof as are issued pursuant to this part, including, without limitation, arranging for the preparation and printing of the bonds, the official statement and any other documents or instruments deemed required for the issuance and sale of bonds, and retaining financial, accounting, and legal consultants, all upon such terms and conditions as the director of finance deems advisable and in the best interest of the State. The director of finance may offer the bonds at competitive sale or may negotiate the sale of the bonds to any person or group of persons, to the United States of America, or any board, agency, instrumentality, or corporation thereof, to the employees retirement system of the State, to any political subdivision of the State, or to any board, agency, instrumentality, public corporation, or other governmental organization of the State or of any political subdivision of the State.</p>

<p>(b) The sale of the bonds by the director of finance by negotiation shall be at such price or prices and upon such terms and conditions, and the bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates or such varying rates determined from time to time in such manner, as the director of finance, with the approval of the governor, shall approve.</p>

<p>&copy; The sale of the bonds by the director of finance at competitive sale shall be at such price or prices and upon such terms and conditions, and the bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates or such varying rates determined from time to time in the manner as specified by the successful bidder, and the bonds shall be sold in accordance with this subsection. The bonds offered at competitive sale shall be sold only after published notice of sale advising prospective purchasers of the proposed sale. The bonds offered at competitive sale may be sold to the bidder offering to purchase the bonds at the lowest interest cost. For the purpose of this subsection, the lowest interest cost shall be determined on any one of the following bases as selected by the director of finance, with the approval of the governor:</p>

<p>(1) The figure obtained by adding together the amounts of interest payable on the bonds from their date to their respective maturity dates at the rate or rates specified by the bidder and deducting from the sum obtained the amount of any premium offered by the bidder;</p>

<p>(2) Where the interest on the bonds is payable annually, the annual interest rate (compounded annually), or, where the interest on the bonds is payable semiannually, the rate obtained by doubling the semiannual interest rate (compounded semiannually), necessary to discount the principal and interest payments on the bonds from the dates of payment thereof to the date of the bonds and to the price bid (the price bid for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include the amount of interest accrued on the bonds from their date to the date of delivery and payment); or</p>

<p>(3) Where the interest on the bonds is payable other than annually or semiannually or will vary from time to time, and which, in the opinion of the director of finance, shall result in the lowest cost to the State;</p>

<p>provided that in any case the right shall be reserved to reject any or all bids and waive any irregularity or informality in any bid.</p>

<p>(d) Bonds offered at competitive sale, without further action, shall bear interest at the rate or rates specified by the successful bidder or varying rates determined from time to time in the manner specified by the successful bidder with the consent of the director of finance. The notice of sale required by this section shall be given at least once and at least five days prior to the date of the sale in the State and in a financial newspaper or newspapers published in any of the cities of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco, and shall be in a form and contain terms and conditions that the director of finance shall determine. The notice of sale shall comply with the requirements of this section if it merely advises prospective purchasers of the proposed sale and makes reference to a detailed notice of sale which is available to prospective purchasers and which sets forth the specific details of the bonds and terms and conditions upon which the bonds are to be offered. The notice of sale and any detailed notice of sale may omit the date and time of sale, in which event the date and time shall be either given in the same manner and medium in which the original notice of sale was given or transmitted via electronic communication systems deemed proper by the director of finance which are generally available to the financial community, in either case at least twenty-four hours prior to the time fixed for the sale.
