The director of finance of each county shall report to the department in writing by December 15 of each year as to the amount of allocation to such county which has not been applied to private activity bonds in such year or assigned pursuant to this chapter. In preparing such report, the director of finance of the county shall deduct any allocation which is unused or unassigned as of December 15 but will be applied to private activity bonds on or prior to December 31 of such year. Unless the director of finance of the county or any issuer, by written certificate, indicates to the department prior to December 15 of each year that it intends to carry forward all or any portion of its allocation which has not been applied to private activity bonds in such year or assigned pursuant to this chapter, such unused or unassigned allocation shall revert to the State on December 31 and the State shall be entitled to carry forward such unused or unassigned allocation as permitted by federal law.
