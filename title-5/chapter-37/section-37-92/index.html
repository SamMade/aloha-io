<p>(b) The proposed appropriations from the general fund for each year of the biennium or each supplementary budget fiscal year for the executive and judicial branches shall not be increased over the appropriations from the general fund for the preceding fiscal year for each branch, respectively, by more than the state growth, except as provided in this section. For purposes of this subsection, the appropriations from the general fund for the executive and judicial branches shall not include any appropriations representing amounts authorized by the legislature under section 37-93(b).</p>

<p>&copy; The governor shall submit a plan of proposed appropriations for the executive branch to the legislature which shall accompany the state budget in odd-numbered years and the supplemental budget in even-numbered years.

<p>(d) The budget documents presented by the governor to the legislature shall include a statement or summary showing (1) the total state personal income for each of the four calendar years immediately preceding the fiscal year for which appropriations from the state general fund are to be made, (2) the appropriations from the general fund for the previous fiscal year, (3) the appropriations from the general fund for the fiscal year in progress, and (4) the general fund expenditure ceiling for the fiscal year in progress and for the ensuing fiscal year or, when necessary, for each fiscal year of the ensuing biennium.</p>

<p>(e) The governor shall also include a statement or summary showing (1) recommended appropriations from the general fund for the executive branch for the ensuing fiscal year or fiscal biennium, (2) actual appropriations from the general fund for the executive branch plus any recommended appropriations from the general fund for the executive branch for the fiscal year in progress, (3) the appropriations from the general fund for the executive branch for the previous fiscal year, and (4) the general fund appropriation ceiling for the executive branch as established by subsection (b) for the fiscal year in progress and for the ensuing fiscal year or, when necessary, for each fiscal year of the ensuing biennium.</p>

<p>(f) The chief justice shall submit a plan of proposed appropriations of the judicial branch to the legislature which shall accompany the judiciary biennial budget in odd-numbered years and the supplemental budget in even-numbered years. The plan of proposed appropriations shall include the judiciary budget, proposed grants to private entities, and any specific appropriation measures to be proposed by the judicial branch.</p>

<p>(g) The budget documents presented by the chief justice to the legislature shall include a statement or summary showing (1) recommended appropriations from the general fund for the judicial branch for the ensuing fiscal year or fiscal biennium, (2) actual appropriations from the general fund for the judicial branch plus any recommended appropriations from the general fund for the judicial branch for the fiscal year in progress, (3) the appropriations from the general fund for the judicial branch for the previous fiscal year, and (4) the general fund appropriation ceiling for the judicial branch as established by subsection (b) for the fiscal year in progress and for the ensuing fiscal year or, when necessary, for each fiscal year of the ensuing biennium.</p>

<p>(h) The governor or the chief justice may propose appropriations from the general fund for the executive or judicial branches, respectively, in excess of those allowed by subsection (b) if the governor or the chief justice sets forth the dollar amount and the percentage change in excess of the appropriations allowed by subsection (b), and the reasons for proposing appropriations in excess of those allowed by subsection (b).
