<p>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p>Details of current year&rsquo;s lapses need not be set forth in supplemental appropriations bill and budget. Att. Gen. Op. 83-4.</p>

<p>Although express words &ldquo;balanced budget&rdquo; are not included in state constitution or statutes relating to state budget, constitutional and statutory provisions do require a balanced budget by requiring a description of proposed expenditures and sources of revenue to pay for them. Att. Gen. Op. 97-1.</p>

<p>Using historical data to make estimates for a future fiscal period is an acceptable planning tool. Att. Gen. Op. 03-2.</p>
