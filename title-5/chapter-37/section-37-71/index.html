<p>(d) The summaries of the state receipts and revenues shall more specifically include:</p>

<p>(1) Financial summaries displaying the State&rsquo;s financial condition, to-wit:</p>

<p>(A) A display of the proposed, total state expenditures, by cost categories, the total state resources anticipated from existing taxes and nontax sources at existing rates, by resource categories (including the available fund balances or deficits and anticipated bond receipts), and the fund balance or deficit resulting therefrom for the biennium in progress, for the ensuing biennium, and for each of the two fiscal years of the ensuing biennium; and</p>

<p>(B) The changes proposed to the existing tax and nontax rates, sources, or structure, and the estimated cumulative increases or reductions, and the estimated fund balance or deficit in the ensuing biennium and in each of the two fiscal years of the biennium as a result of such proposed changes. Proposals for changes in the existing tax and nontax rates, sources, or structure shall be made in every case where the proposed, total state expenditures exceed the total state resources anticipated from existing tax and nontax sources at existing rates.</p>

<p>Such financial summaries shall be prepared for the total state expenditures and resources and for the general fund and special fund portions thereof;</p>

<p>(B) Bonds to be issued during the remainder of the fiscal biennium in progress and during the ensuing fiscal biennium; and</p>

<p>&copy; The total bonds currently outstanding and to be issued.</p>

The projection shall extend at least five years beyond the close of the ensuing fiscal biennium. An explanation shall be appended to the schedule, which shall include among other things, the amount of bonds to be issued during the fiscal year in progress and in each of the two fiscal years of the ensuing biennium, the maturities of the bonds to be issued, the method of retirement, and the interest rate assumed in the projection;</p>

<p>&copy; The total estimated revenues with and without the proposed changes;</p>

<p>(8) A summary of the State&rsquo;s total payments due under financing agreements required to carry out the recommended programs and the kinds of financing agreements and amounts thereof through which those requirements are to be met in the biennium in progress and in each of the two fiscal years in the ensuing biennium. The summary shall detail for the biennium in progress and for each of the two years of the ensuing biennium:</p>

<p>(A) Of the total financing agreement requirements, the amount, by cost categories, requiring new financing agreement authorizations and the kinds and amounts of financing agreements planned for execution and delivery under the new authorizations;</p>

<p>(B) By cost category, the cumulative balance of financing agreements authorized in prior years but not executed and delivered and the amount thereof proposed to be executed and delivered; and</p>

<p>&copy; A recapitulation of the total financing agreements to be executed and delivered, including both new authorizations and prior authorizations, by cost categories; and</p>

<p>(1) A statement of the percentage differences between the current biennium recommendations and the previous biennium appropriations for education programs. The information shall be displayed by programs or groups of programs, with corresponding amounts and percentage differences.

<p>(2) A statement of the difference between the total amount proposed for the current biennium and the total amount expended in the previous biennium for education programs per pupil; and</p>

<p>(3) Other financial statements, information, and data that in the opinion of the governor are necessary or desirable in order to make known in all practical detail the programs, program plans, and financial conditions of the State.</p>

<p>As used in this subsection, &ldquo;education programs&rdquo; include instructional, personnel, transportation, facilities, facilities repair and maintenance, and other programs deemed appropriate by the department of education.</p>

<p>(f) The proposed budget shall contain an item to be known as the &ldquo;contingent fund&rdquo;, which sum, upon approval by the legislature, shall be available for allocation by the governor during the ensuing fiscal biennium to meet contingencies as they arise.</p>

<p>(g) If it is deemed more practical, the six-year program and financial plan and the budget may be combined into a single document containing all the information required for each separate document. [L 1970, c 185, §10; ren and am L 1972, c 72, pt of §§3, 6; am L 1974, c 219, §5; am L 1980, c 64, §1; am L Sp 1981 1st, c 3, §4; am L 1991, c 125, §3; am L 1993, c 364, §5; am L 1996, c 119, §5; am L 2015, c 146, §4 and c 160, §6]</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>Applicability of 2015 amendments. L 2015, c 146, §6 and c 160, §11.</p>

<p>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p>Current year&rsquo;s lapses not considered part of &ldquo;total state resources&rdquo;. Details of current year&rsquo;s lapses need not be set forth in supplemental appropriations bill and budget. Att. Gen. Op. 83-4.</p>

<p>Although express words &ldquo;balanced budget&rdquo; are not included in state constitution or statutes relating to state budget, constitutional and statutory provisions do require a balanced budget by requiring a description of proposed expenditures and sources of revenue to pay for them. Att. Gen. Op. 97-1.</p>

<p>Improper for biennial budget for fiscal biennium to incorporate as revenues proposed restrictions for fiscal year unless those restrictions were reflected as reduced appropriations in budget adopted legislatively for the fiscal year. Appropriations for fiscal year that are restricted through allotment system are not &ldquo;available resources&rdquo; for purposes of budget preparation pursuant to this section. Att. Gen. Op. 03-2.</p>

<p>Restrictions imposed in one fiscal year cannot be counted as &ldquo;available resources&rdquo; for the next fiscal year. Att. Gen. Op. 03-2.</p>
