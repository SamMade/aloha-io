The website shall include data for fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter. The director of finance is authorized to designate one or more state agencies to participate in the development, establishment, maintenance, and support of the website; provided that the department of accounting and general services, in collaboration with the department of budget and finance, is responsible for collecting and posting on the website, the information that is required by this subsection.
