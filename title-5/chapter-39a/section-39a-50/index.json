The benefits estimated shall be based on a comparison between the use of the proceeds of the special purpose revenue bonds instead of other means of financing and shall be in terms of dollars projected to be or actually saved by consumers of the services of the project party. The format of and method for determining the estimates shall be established by the department and shall be uniform for each project party. (b) To promote public understanding of the role played by special purpose revenue bonds in providing less costly services by a project party to the general public, the department shall take appropriate steps to ensure public access to and scrutiny of the estimates determined under subsection (a). &amp;copy; The department shall adopt rules under chapter 91 for the purposes of this section.
