  "context": "[ยง39A-286] Issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance projects. In addition to the other powers that it may otherwise have, the department may issue special purpose revenue bonds to finance or refinance the costs of developing low- and moderate-income housing or to loan the proceeds of bonds to assist project parties in the development of low- and moderate-income housing. All bonds issued under this part are special purpose revenue bonds and the provisions of part III of chapter 39 shall not apply. All special purpose revenue bonds shall be issued in the name of the department and not in the name of the State. In determining the cost of any project, the department may also include: (1) Financing charges, fees, the expenses of trustees, and the cost of paying agents to issue special purpose revenue bonds to fund the project; (2) Interest on the bonds and the expenses of the State in connection with the bonds and the project to be financed or refinanced from the proceeds of the bonds accruing or incurred prior to and during the period of construction, not to exceed twelve months thereafter; (3) Amounts necessary to establish or increase reserves for the special purpose revenue bonds; (4) The cost of plans, specifications, studies, surveys, and estimates of costs and of revenues; (5) Other expenses incidental to determining the feasibility or practicability of the project; (6) Administration expenses; (7) The cost of interest incurred by the project party with respect to the project prior to the issuance of the special purpose revenue bonds; (8) Fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing of outstanding obligations; (9) Other costs, commissions, and expenses incidental to the project; (10) The financing or refinancing of the project and placing the project in operation; and (11) The issuance of the special purpose revenue bonds, whether incurred prior to or after the issuance of the bonds. The legislature finds and determines that the exercise of the powers vested in the department by this part constitutes assistance to not-for-profit private organizations, for-profit private organizations, and public instrumentalities and their qualified affiliates in the development of low- and moderate-income housing, and that the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance or refinance projects of or for project parties or to loan the proceeds of the bonds to assist project parties in the development of low- and moderate-income housing is in the public interest. The legislature further finds that this governmental assistance to not-for-profit private organizations, for-profit private organizations, and public instrumentalities and their qualified affiliates is necessary to encourage public-private partnerships to develop affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in the State.
