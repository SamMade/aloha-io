  "context": "[PART XII.] ASSISTING DAM AND RESERVOIR OWNERS Note This part was enacted by Act 147 (2012). Section 3 of Act 147 provides: &amp;ldquo;SECTION 3. This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012, and upon ratification of constitutional amendments [sic] authorizing the State to issue special purpose revenue bonds and use the proceeds from the bonds to assist dam and reservoir owners.&amp;rdquo; Although House Bill No. 2594 (2012) proposed an amendment to article VII, ยง12 of the state constitution to authorize the State to issue special purpose revenue bonds and use the proceeds from the bonds to assist dam and reservoir owners, that constitutional amendment was not ratified in the 2012 election. However, in 2014, Senate Bill No. 2876 proposed an amendment to the same article and section of the state constitution to similarly authorize the State to issue special purpose revenue bonds and use the proceeds from the bonds to assist dam and reservoir owners. That constitutional amendment was ratified in the 2014 election. [ยง39A-341] Definitions.
