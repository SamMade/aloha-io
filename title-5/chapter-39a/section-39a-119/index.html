      <p><strong>ยง39A-119 Powers with respect to and security for special purpose revenue bonds.</strong> In order to secure the payment of any of the special purpose revenue bonds issued pursuant to this part, and interest thereon, or in connection with such bonds, the department shall have the power as to such bonds:</p>

<p>(1) To pledge all or any part of the revenues derived by the department from the project agreement to the punctual payment of special purpose revenue bonds issued with respect to the project financed from proceeds thereof, and interest thereon, and to covenant against thereafter pledging any such revenues or receipts to any other bonds or any other obligations of the department for any other obligations of the department for any other purpose, except as otherwise stated in the law providing for the issuance of additional special purpose revenue bonds to be equally and ratably secured by a lien upon such revenues.</p>

<p>(2) To pledge and assign the interest and right of the department under the project agreement and other agreements related thereto and the rights, duties, and obligations of the department thereunder, including the right to receive revenues thereunder.</p>

<p>(3) To covenant as to the use and disposition of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds.</p>

<p>(4) To covenant to set aside or pay over reserves and sinking funds for such bonds and as to the disposition thereof.</p>

<p>(5) To covenant and prescribe as to what happenings or occurrences shall constitute &ldquo;events of default&rdquo; and the terms and conditions upon which any or all of such bonds shall become or may be declared due before maturity and as to the terms and conditions upon which such declaration and its consequences may be waived.</p>

<p>(6) To covenant as to the rights, liabilities, powers, and duties arising upon the breach by it of any covenant, condition, or obligation.</p>

<p>(7) To designate a national or state bank or trust company within or without the State, incorporated in the United States, to serve as trustee for the holders of the special purpose revenue bonds and to enter into a trust indenture or trust agreement or indenture of mortgage with such trustee. The trustee may be authorized by the department to receive and receipt for, hold, and administer the proceeds of the special purpose revenue bonds issued for the project and to apply the proceeds to the purposes for which such bonds are issued, or to receive and receipt for, hold, and administer the revenues derived by the department under the project agreement and to apply such revenues to the payment of the principal and interest on such bonds, or both, and any excess revenues to the payment of expenses incurred by the State in administering such bonds or in carrying out the project agreement. In the event that such trustee shall be appointed, any trust indenture or trust agreement or indenture of mortgage entered into by the department with the trustee may contain whatever covenants and provisions as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to secure such bonds. The department may pledge and assign to the trustee the interest of the department under the project agreement and other agreements related thereto and the rights, duties, and obligations of the department thereunder, including the right to receive revenues thereunder. The department may appoint the trustee to serve as fiscal agent for the payment of the principal and interest, and for the purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption of the special purpose revenue bonds, and may authorize and empower the trustee to perform such functions with respect to such payment, purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, as the department may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient, including without limitation the holding of the special purpose revenue bonds and coupons which have been paid and the supervision of the destruction thereof in accordance with law.</p>

<p>(8) To execute all instruments necessary or convenient in the exercise of the powers herein granted or in the performance of its covenants and duties.</p>

<p>(9) To make such covenants and do any and all acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to secure such bonds, notwithstanding that such covenants, acts, or things may not be enumerated herein; it being the purpose thereof to give the department power to do all things in the issuance of such bonds and for their security that may be consistent with the Constitution of the State of Hawaii.
