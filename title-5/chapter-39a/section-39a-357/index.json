By act enacted by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled, the legislature may provide for the issuance of a single issue of special purpose revenue bonds for the combined purposes of: (1) Financing or refinancing the cost of a project or improvement or expansion thereof; and (2) Refunding special purpose revenue bonds that shall theretofore have been issued under this part and shall then be outstanding, whether or not the outstanding special purpose revenue bonds have matured or are then subject to redemption.

The issuance of refunding special purpose revenue bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights and remedies of the holders thereof, and the rights, powers, privileges, duties, and obligations of the department with respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this part insofar as the same may be applicable.
