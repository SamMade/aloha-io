<p>&ldquo;Adulterated&rdquo; shall apply to any carcass, part thereof, meat or meat products under one or more of the following circumstances:</p>

<p>(1) If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance, the meat or meat products shall not be considered adulterated under this paragraph if the quantity of the substance in or on the meat or meat products does not ordinarily render it injurious to health.</p>

<p>(2) (A) If it bears or contains (by reason of administration of any substance to the live animal or otherwise) any added poisonous or added deleterious substance (other than one which is (i) a pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity; (ii) a food additive; or (iii) a color additive) which, in the judgment of the board, may make the meat or meat products unfit for human consumption.</p>

<p>(B) If it is, in whole or in part, a raw agricultural commodity and the commodity bears or contains a pesticide chemical which is unsafe within the meaning of the Hawaii Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p>

<p>&copy; If it bears or contains any food additive which is unsafe within the meaning of the Hawaii Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p>

<p>(D) If it bears or contains any color additive which is unsafe within the meaning of the Hawaii Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or section 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, provided that meat or meat products which are unadulterated under subparagraphs (B), &copy;, or (D) shall nevertheless be deemed adulterated if use of the pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive in or on the meat or meat products is prohibited by rules of the board in establishments at which inspection is maintained under part IV.</p>

<p>(3) If it consists, in whole or in part, of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food.</p>

<p>(6) If its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health.</p>

<p>(8) If any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom; or if any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part therefor; or if damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear better or of greater value than it is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Board&rdquo; means the board of agriculture of the State.</p>

<p>(6) If any word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or other labeling is not prominently placed thereon with the conspicuousness as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling and in the terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.</p>

<p>(7) If it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity or composition has been prescribed by the board under this chapter unless:</p>

<p>(10) If it purports to be or is represented for special dietary uses, unless its label bears the information concerning its vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties as the board, after consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and concurrence by the department of health, determines to be and prescribes as necessary in order fully to inform purchasers as to its value for the uses.</p>

<p>(11) If it bears or contains any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, unless it bears labeling stating that fact; provided that to the extent that compliance with this paragraph is impracticable, exemptions shall be established by the board.</p>

<p>(12) If it fails to bear, directly thereon or on its container, as the board may prescribe, the inspection legend and, unrestricted by any of the foregoing, other information as the board may require to assure that it will not have false or misleading labeling and that the public will be informed of the manner of handling required to maintain the meat or meat products in a wholesome condition.</p>
