  "context": "§144-7 Misbranding. No person shall distribute or import misbranded feed. A commercial, toll-milled, or custom-mixed feed shall be deemed to be misbranded: (1) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. (2) If it is distributed under the name of another feed. (3) If it is not labeled as required in section 144-4 and in rules prescribed under this chapter. (4) If it purports to be or is represented as a commercial feed, or if it purports to contain or is represented as containing a feed ingredient, unless such commercial feed or feed ingredient conforms to the definition of identity, if any, prescribed by rules of the department. In the adoption of such rules the department shall give due regard to commonly accepted definitions such as those issued by the Association of American Feed Control Officials. (5) If any word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
