(a) All licensees are subject to sampling of their industrial hemp crop to verify that the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration does not exceed 0.3 per cent on a dry weight basis or a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration allowed by federal law, whichever is greater. (b) During the inspection, the licensee or the licensee&amp;rsquo;s authorized representative shall be present at the growing area. The licensee or authorized representative shall provide the board&amp;rsquo;s inspector with complete and unrestricted access to all industrial hemp plants and seeds whether growing or harvested; all land, buildings, and other structures used for the cultivation and storage of industrial hemp; and all documents and records pertaining to the licensee&amp;rsquo;s industrial hemp business. &amp;copy; Sampling of industrial hemp plants shall occur in the following manner: (1) Samples of each variety of industrial hemp may be sampled from the growing areas at the board&amp;rsquo;s discretion; (2) Quantitative laboratory determination of the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration on a dry weight basis shall be performed according to protocols approved by the chairperson; (3) A sample test result greater than 0.3 per cent of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration or a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration allowed by federal law, whichever is greater, shall be considered conclusive evidence that at least one cannabis plant or part of a plant in the growing area contains a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration over the limit allowed for industrial hemp and that the licensee of that growing area is therefore not in compliance with this part. Upon receipt of such a test result, the chairperson may summarily suspend and revoke the license of an industrial hemp licensee. The chairperson shall furnish to the licensee a portion of the violative sample if the licensee requests it within thirty days of notification; and (4) Test results from an institution of higher education may, at the chairperson&amp;rsquo;s discretion, be accepted in lieu of board sampling. (d) Licensees shall pay a charge of $35 per hour per inspector for actual drive time, mileage, inspection, and sampling time. (e) Licensees shall reimburse the board for all laboratory analysis costs incurred. [L 2016, c 228, pt of ยง2] "
