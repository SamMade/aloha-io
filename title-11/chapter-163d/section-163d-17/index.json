The manner of payback may include the payment of dividends, returns from the public sale of corporate securities or products, royalties, and other methods of payback acceptable to the corporation. In determining the manner of payback the corporation shall establish a rate of return or rate of interest to be paid on any investment, loan, or grant of corporation funds under this section.
