The terms of these eight members shall be four years; provided that, commencing on July 1, 2005, the governor shall reduce the terms of those initially appointed so as to provide, as nearly as can be, for the expiration of an equal number of terms at intervals of one year. The eight members shall be selected on the basis of their knowledge, experience, and proven expertise in small and large businesses within the agricultural industry, agricultural economics, banking, real estate, finance, promotion, marketing, and management. Of these eight members, one shall be from the city and county of Honolulu, one shall be from the county of Hawaii, one shall be from the county of Maui, one shall be from the county of Kauai, and four shall be appointed at-large.
