The department may pay indemnities to owners of cattle sent to slaughter as reactors to the brucellosis test. The payment shall be in the amount of one-third of the difference between the appraised value of each animal slaughtered and the salvage value thereof to owners of cattle reacting positively to the brucellosis test and sent to slaughter; provided that in no case shall this amount exceed $75 per animal; and provided further that no indemnity shall be paid for steers and spayed heifers. The department shall prescribe and enforce rules under which the amount of indemnification shall be ascertained, pursuant to this section. The amount of indemnification having been thus ascertained, the owner may present to the state comptroller a claim against the State therefor. A warrant for the payment of the claim shall be made upon vouchers approved by the department and supported by the inspector&amp;rsquo;s report. The department may take such action that it may deem necessary to further the provisions of this section over any ensuing fiscal period.
