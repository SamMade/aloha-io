  "context": "§143-16 Contract between county of Kauai and Kauai Humane Society. Pursuant to the authorization provided in section 143-15 the county council of the county of Kauai shall contract with the Kauai Humane Society, an incorporated nonprofit association organized under the laws of the State for the prevention of cruelty to animals, upon the subject matters contained in section 143-15 and shall appropriate the moneys collected by the director of finance of the county of Kauai under section 143-3 for use by the Kauai Humane Society. In addition to the matter contained in section 143-15 the Kauai Humane Society may expend funds turned over by the county to construct a dog pound on Kauai; provided that the county council shall first approve the plans for the construction and location of the dog pound. [L 1953, c 117, §1; am L 1955, c 8, §1; RL 1955, §156-16; HRS §143-16] Revision Note &amp;ldquo;County council&amp;rdquo; substituted for &amp;ldquo;board of supervisors&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;director of finance&amp;rdquo; substituted for &amp;ldquo;treasurer&amp;rdquo; to reflect present titles under county charter. Attorney General Opinions The plain language and legislative history of this section and §143-15 made very clear that legislature intended to authorize county reliance upon private humane societies to impound stray dogs within their borders; this can be accomplished only if §§76-16(17) and 76-77(10) are interpreted broadly. Att. Gen. Op. 97-6. "
