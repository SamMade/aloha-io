  "context": "[§166E-13] Rights of holders of security interests. (a) Prior board action shall be required when an institutional lender acquires the lessee&amp;rsquo;s interest through a foreclosure sale, judicial or nonjudicial, or by way of assignment in lieu of foreclosure, or when the institutional lender sells or causes the sale of the lessee&amp;rsquo;s interest in a lease by way of a foreclosure sale, judicial or nonjudicial. The institutional lender shall convey a copy of the sale or assignment as recorded in the bureau of conveyances. (b) Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter, if any lease is subject to a security interest held by an institutional lender and if the institutional lender has given to the board a copy of the encumbrance as recorded in the bureau of conveyances: (1) If the lease is canceled for violation of any non-monetary lease term or condition, or if the lease is deemed terminated or rejected under bankruptcy laws, the institutional lender shall be entitled to issuance of a new lease in its name for a term equal to the term of the lease remaining immediately prior to the cancellation, termination, or rejection, with all terms and conditions being the same as in the canceled, terminated, or rejected lease, except only for the liens, claims, and encumbrances, if any, that were superior to the institutional lender before the cancellation, termination, or rejection. If a lease is rejected or deemed rejected under bankruptcy law, the lease shall be deemed canceled and terminated for all purposes under state law; (2) If the lessee&amp;rsquo;s interest under a lease is transferred to an institutional lender, including by reason of the provisions of paragraph (1), by reason of acquisition of the lessee&amp;rsquo;s interest pursuant to a foreclosure sale, judicial or nonjudicial, and by reason of an assignment in lieu of foreclosure: (A) The institutional lender shall be liable for the obligations of the lessee under the lease for the period of time during which the institutional lender is the holder of the lessee&amp;rsquo;s interest but shall not be liable for any obligations of the lessee arising after the institutional lender has assigned the lease; and (B) The provisions of section 166E-8(b)(1) and (2) shall not apply to the lease or the demised land during such time as the institutional lender holds the lease; provided that: (i) For non-monetary lease violations, the institutional lender shall first remedy the lease terms that caused the cancellation, termination, or rejection to the satisfaction of the board; and (ii) The new lease issued to the institutional lender shall terminate one hundred twenty days from the effective date of issuance, when the institutional lender shall either sell or assign the lease, after which date section 166E-8(b)(1) and (2) shall apply to the new lease; (3) As long as there is a delinquent loan balance secured by a security interest, the lease may not be canceled or terminated, except for cancellation by reason of default of the lessee, and no increase over and above the fair market rent, based upon the actual use of the land demised and subject to the use restrictions imposed by the lease and applicable laws, may be imposed or become payable, and no lands may be withdrawn from the lease, except by eminent domain proceedings beyond the control of the board, except with prior written consent by the institutional lender and that consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and (4) If the lease contains any provision requiring the payment of a premium to the lessor on assignment of the lease, any premium shall be assessed only after all amounts owing by any debt secured by a security interest held by an institutional lender shall have been paid in full. &amp;copy; Ownership of both the lease and the security interest by an institutional lender shall not effect or cause a merger thereof, and both interests shall remain distinct and in full force and effect unless the institutional lender elects in writing to merge the estates with the consent of the board. (d) The board may include in any consent form or document provisions consistent with the intent of this section as may be required to make a lease mortgageable or more acceptable for mortgageability by an institutional lender. (e) The rights of a purchaser, assignee, or transferee of an institutional lender&amp;rsquo;s security interest, including a junior lien holder, shall be exercisable by the purchaser, assignee, or transferee as successor in interest to the institutional lender; provided that: (1) The purchase, assignment, or transfer shall conform with subsection (b)(4); and (2) The purchase, assignment, or transfer of such rights shall be reserved for and exercisable only by an institutional lender. Other purchasers may not be precluded from acquiring the institutional lender&amp;rsquo;s security interest but shall not have exercisable rights as successor in interest to the original institutional lender. (f) For the purposes of this section: &amp;ldquo;Institutional lender&amp;rdquo; means a federal, state, or private lending institution licensed to do business in the State and that makes loans to qualified applicants under this chapter on the basis of a lease awarded pursuant to this chapter for security, in whole or in part, together with any other entity that acquires all or substantially all of an institutional lender&amp;rsquo;s loan portfolio. &amp;ldquo;Making a loan&amp;rdquo; means lending of new money or the renewal or extension of indebtedness owing by a qualified applicant to an institutional lender, after June 30, 2006. &amp;ldquo;Security interest&amp;rdquo; means any interest created or perfected by a mortgage, assignment by way of mortgage, or by a financing statement and encumbering a lease, land demised by the lease, or personal property located at, affixed or to be affixed to, or growing or to be grown upon the demised land.
