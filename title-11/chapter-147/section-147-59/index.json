The board of agriculture may designate any employee or agent of the department of agriculture to perform continuous factory inspection or classification of food products, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the department may prescribe, at the request of persons having an interest in the products, and to ascertain and certify to the persons the grade, classification, quality, or condition thereof and such other pertinent facts as the department may require. Such inspections, classifications and certifications shall be requested, and in no case shall be required by the department. Subject to rules and regulations prescribed by the department, an appropriate state label or mark or marks, established and adopted by the department, may be used on packages or containers of food products which are so continuously inspected and graded and are found to meet the official grades or standards of the department shown on the label or by the mark or marks. The labels shall include a statement of the official grade or standard of the product contained in the package or container, as graded or classified under this part, and may include, in whole or in part, a facsimile of the seal of the department. The department may register any label as a trademark under the laws of the State or may register it with the United States government and any state or foreign government. The department may fix, assess, and collect, or cause to be collected, fees for the use of labels or marks or may print and sell the labels, at charges to be fixed by the department, to persons authorized to use them on packages or containers, or may rent dies or cuts of labels or marks, at a charge to be fixed by the department, to persons authorized to use them.
