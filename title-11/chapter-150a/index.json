Attorney General Opinions Department of agriculture has responsibility to keep State free of imported agricultural pests, and may receive gifts to assist in preventing entry of brown tree snakes into State. Att. Gen. Op. 92-4. Case Notes While this chapter and the board&amp;rsquo;s microorganism import rules may have vested the board with exclusive authority to approve marine biotechnology firm&amp;rsquo;s proposal to import and grow genetically engineered algae at the State&amp;rsquo;s research and technology park, as the demonstration project constituted an action that proposed the use of state land, §343-5 plainly and unambiguously required the preparation of an environmental assessment before the board could approve firm&amp;rsquo;s application. 118 H. 247 (App.), 188 P.3d 761.
