The board may issue certificates of sanitation to poultry slaughterhouses and poultry processors which are subject to this chapter and which meet minimum sanitary specifications required for (1) the slaughtering of poultry for use of the poultry or poultry products in intrastate commerce, and (2) for the processing, transporting, storing, and handling of poultry or poultry products in intrastate commerce. The board may adopt rules subject to chapter 91 governing the minimum sanitary specifications and prescribing forms, requiring reports, and providing for periodic renewals of certificates of sanitation. Notwithstanding any requirement under this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter which require the renovation or upgrading of the physical facilities of poultry slaughterhouses or poultry processors in order to obtain a certificate of sanitation, the board, as of July 1, 1970, shall continue to issue certificates of sanitation to poultry slaughterhouses and poultry processors now licensed by the State, and shall allow them to continue their operations; provided that the facilities of the poultry slaughterhouses and poultry processors shall be sanitary and that the products which emerge from their respective operations are wholesome, not adulterated, and fit for human consumption; and provided further that upon the sale or transfer of any of the foregoing businesses, the person to whom the business is transferred shall be required to meet all of the requirements of this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter.
