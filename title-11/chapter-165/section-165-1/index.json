  "context": "ยง165-1 Findings and purpose. The legislature finds that when nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural areas, farming operations often become the subject of nuisance lawsuits that may result in the premature removal of lands from agricultural use and may discourage future investments in agriculture. The legislature also finds that under the Hawaii State Planning Act, it is a declared policy of this State to &amp;ldquo;foster attitudes and activities conducive to maintaining agriculture as a major sector of Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s economy.&amp;rdquo; Accordingly, it is the purpose of this chapter to reduce the loss to the State of its agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which farming operations may be deemed to be a nuisance.
