  "context": "ยง157-35 Compensatory payment. Whenever any distributor or producer-distributor sells recombined or reconstituted milk for fluid human consumption in a milk shed, the distributor or producer-distributor shall pay the board a compensatory payment to be distributed to all producers who supply milk to the distributor or producer-distributor. In determining the compensatory payment, the board shall hold a public hearing whenever it deems it necessary to establish the loss of quota suffered by the producers from the sale of recombined or reconstituted milk, the reasonable rate of return the producers would have received if recombined or reconstituted milk were not sold to the public, and the pro rata share each producer should receive from the compensatory fund. The board may, at the request of a distributor or producer-distributor or on its own motion, suspend the operation of this section during periods when the production of milk by producers is inadequate to meet consumer requirements.
