All licenses and identification cards so surrendered shall be shredded; provided that with the exception of driver&rsquo;s licenses issued by any Canadian province, a foreign driver&rsquo;s license may be returned to the owner after being invalidated pursuant to issuance of a Hawaii license; provided further that the examiner of drivers shall notify the authority that issued the foreign license that the license has been invalidated and returned because the owner is now licensed in this State; and provided further that all commercial driver&rsquo;s licenses that are surrendered shall be shredded. No person shall be permitted to hold more than one valid driver&rsquo;s license at any time.</p>

<p>(d) Before issuing a driver&rsquo;s license, the examiner of drivers shall complete a check of the applicant&rsquo;s driving record to determine whether the applicant is subject to any disqualification under section 286-240, or any license suspension, revocation, or cancellation, and whether the applicant has a driver&rsquo;s license from more than one state or jurisdiction.

The examiner of drivers shall not reinstate an obligor&rsquo;s or individual&rsquo;s license until the child support enforcement agency, the office of child support hearings, or the family court issues an authorization that states the obligor or individual is in compliance with an order of support or has complied with a subpoena or warrant relating to a paternity or child support hearing.</p>
