For section effective until December 31, 2016, see main volume.] Whoever operates, permits the operation of, causes to be operated, or parks any vehicle or moped on a public highway without a current official certificate of inspection, issued under section 286-26, shall be fined not more than $100. [L 1967, c 214, pt of §2; HRS §286-25; am L 1972, c 18, §1; am L 1974, c 106, §1; am L 1993, c 214, §3; am L 2016, c 200, §10] Case Notes Statute applied to defendant, where defendant argued that traffic statutes involved only applied to businesses and state vehicles; statute did not violate defendants freedom of movement. 77 H. 222 (App.), 883 P.2d 644. It is within the power of the legislature to motivate compliance with safety inspection and liability insurance laws by imposing the penalty specified in this section; because the offense of &amp;ldquo;expired safety sticker&amp;rdquo; is a civil traffic infraction and not a criminal offense, the district court improperly found motorist &amp;ldquo;guilty&amp;rdquo;. 107 H. 508 (App.), 115 P.3d 687.
