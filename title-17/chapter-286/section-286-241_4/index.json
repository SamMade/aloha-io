(a) The examiner of drivers may suspend, revoke, cancel, mark the medical certification status as not-certified, or downgrade any commercial driver&amp;rsquo;s license or commercial learner&amp;rsquo;s permit without a hearing when the examiner of drivers has probable cause to believe that the licensee or permittee is disqualified under section 286-240.

Both the licensee or permittee and the licensee&amp;rsquo;s or permittee&amp;rsquo;s employer shall be notified of the denial or suspension. &amp;copy; Upon suspension, revocation, or cancellation of the commercial driver&amp;rsquo;s license or commercial learner&amp;rsquo;s permit, the driver&amp;rsquo;s license or learner&amp;rsquo;s permit shall be surrendered to the examiner of drivers by the licensee or permittee.
