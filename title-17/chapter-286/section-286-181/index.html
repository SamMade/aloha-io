<p>(b) The department of transportation shall grant exemptions for the use of vehicles other than school vehicles when the department finds that compliance with this section is:</p>

<p>(5) In accordance with the procedures and criteria established by rules of the department of transportation.</p>

<p>(d) The department of transportation may grant exemptions for the use of vehicles other than school vehicles for the transportation of students requiring special education and services when the department finds that compliance with this section is impossible or impractical; provided that no exemption shall be granted for the qualifications of individuals driving a bus as defined in section 286-2 and such individuals shall meet school vehicle driver qualifications.</p>

The director of transportation may request that the executive officers of each county and any other state agency having responsibility relative to pupil transportation provide additional enforcement of any rule adopted by the department of transportation.</p>
