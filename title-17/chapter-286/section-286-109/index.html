      <p><strong>§286-109 General provision governing the issuance of licenses.</strong> (a) Upon payment of the required fee and upon demonstrating the ability to operate a certain category or categories of motor vehicles to the satisfaction of the examiner of drivers, an applicant for a driver&rsquo;s license shall be issued a single license of a design approved by the director of transportation upon which is made a notation of:</p>

<p>(1) The category or categories of motor vehicles the applicant may operate;</p>

<p>(2) Any restrictive provisions to which the license is subject;</p>

<p>(3) Veteran status, if desired by the applicant; provided that the notation shall be on the front of the license and shall not include any designation other than the term &ldquo;veteran&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(4) When the license is issued to a person under twenty-one years of age, a statement, in clearly legible print that shall contrast with the other information appearing on the license, which indicates the date on which the person will attain the age of twenty-one years.</p>

<p>As used in this subsection, &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; means any person who served in any of the uniformed services of the United States, including veterans of the Korean conflict and persons who served in the armed forces of the Republic of Korea, who fought under the command of the United Nations led by the United States, during the Korean conflict and are currently United States citizens, and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.</p>

<p>(b) The examiner of drivers shall not issue or renew any driver&rsquo;s license using the driver&rsquo;s social security number on the driver&rsquo;s license.</p>

<p>&copy; Statutes of limitations and other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, no driver&rsquo;s license or instruction permit shall be issued or renewed under this section, where the examiner of drivers is notified by the district judge, traffic violations bureaus of the district courts, or the judge of the circuit court that the applicant has failed to respond to a traffic citation or summons, or failed to appear in court after an arrest for the violation of any traffic laws of a county, this chapter or chapter 286G, 287, 290, 291, or 291C, or of any motor vehicle insurance laws under article 10C of chapter 431, or of any motorcycle or motor scooter insurance laws under article 10G of chapter 431, and the same remains delinquent and outstanding, or the applicant, has as of the time of the application, failed to comply in full with all orders of the court; provided that the district court with whose order an applicant has failed to comply in full, may approve the issuance or renewal of a driver&rsquo;s license or instruction permit other than a commercial driver&rsquo;s license upon conditions imposed by the court for the satisfaction of the outstanding court order and any other conditions as may be imposed by the court, if one or more of the following conditions are met:</p>

<p>(1) The applicant is gainfully employed in a position that requires driving and will be discharged if the applicant is unable to drive; or</p>

<p>(2) The applicant has no access to alternative transportation and therefore must drive to work;</p>

<p>provided further that if the applicant has failed to comply in full with orders of the district court of more than one circuit, the applicant shall obtain the approval of the district court of each circuit in which the applicant has an outstanding court order before a driver&rsquo;s license or instruction permit may be issued or renewed under this subsection.</p>

<p>A driver&rsquo;s license or instruction permit issued or renewed under this subsection shall be subject to immediate suspension by the court upon the applicant&rsquo;s failure to remain in full compliance with all conditions imposed by the court for the issuance or renewal of the driver&rsquo;s license or instruction permit. The examiner of drivers may place an indication of restriction upon a driver&rsquo;s license or instruction permit issued or renewed under this subsection. Proof of financial responsibility under section 287-20 shall not apply to the issuance or renewal of driver&rsquo;s licenses or instruction permits under this subsection.
