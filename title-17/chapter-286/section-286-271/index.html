      <p><strong>[PART XV.] INTERISLAND SHIPPING OF VEHICLES</strong></p>

<p><strong>§286-271 Interisland shipping of vehicles; proof required.</strong> (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), a legal owner of a vehicle shall not ship that vehicle interisland in this State unless the legal owner first presents to the carrier the legal owner&rsquo;s current certificate of registration showing that the person is the registered owner of the vehicle, identification, and proof of motor vehicle insurance. If the registered owner of the vehicle is not the legal owner of the vehicle, the registered owner shall present to the carrier, the registered owner&rsquo;s current certificate of registration, identification, and proof of motor vehicle insurance. Duplicate copies of the current registration and proof of motor vehicle insurance shall be acceptable for commercial vehicles as defined in section 286-47(3)&copy;. An authorized agent of the legal or registered owner may ship the vehicle by presenting the current certificate of registration, identification, proof of motor vehicle insurance, and a notarized letter from the registered or legal owner authorizing the shipment. For an unrecorded owner pending a lawful transfer, a certificate of ownership signed by the previous owner may be submitted for the current certificate of registration for a vehicle purchased within thirty days of shipping. A facsimile of proof of motor vehicle insurance from an insurance company may be accepted for a vehicle purchased within thirty days of shipping. Presentation of proof of motor vehicle insurance shall not be required for:</p>

<p>(1) Unlicensed propelled vehicles that are not intended for on-road use;</p>

<p>(2) New unregistered vehicles shipped with a bill of lading; or</p>

<p>(3) Vehicles owned by the federal, state, or county government.</p>

<p>(b) A legal owner of a damaged vehicle shall not ship that vehicle interisland in this State for repair, disposal, or salvage unless the legal owner first presents to the carrier the legal owner&rsquo;s current certificate of registration showing that the person is the registered owner of the vehicle or a car dealer&rsquo;s license. For an unrecorded owner pending a lawful transfer, a certificate of ownership signed by the previous owner may be acceptable for a vehicle purchased within thirty days of shipping. A registered owner of the vehicle who is not the legal owner of the vehicle must present a current certificate of registration.</p>

<p>&copy; Any legal or registered owner who violates this section shall be fined not more than $100.</p>

<p>(d) The carrier shall record by physical inspection the vehicle identification number (VIN) of the vehicle and maintain a record of the transporting of the vehicle along with the description of the vehicle for a period of not less than three years.</p>

<p>(e) This section shall not apply to:</p>

<p>(1) Any motor vehicle rental company as defined in section 431:9A-141 that periodically ships in quantities of ten vehicles or more;</p>

<p>(2) Licensed dealers who periodically ship in quantities of ten vehicles or more, or whose primary business is the auction of insurance salvage vehicles;</p>

<p>(3) Except for a lessee of a rental motor vehicle under paragraph (4), drivers of vehicles transported by any water carrier authorized by the public utilities commission to transport vehicles interisland; provided that the driver presents identification, a current certificate of registration for the vehicle, and proof of motor vehicle insurance. The interisland water carrier shall keep a record of transporting the vehicle by recording the vehicle identification number and retaining the information for three years after the date of travel; or</p>

<p>(4) A lessee of a rental motor vehicle; provided that:</p>

<p>(A) The rental motor vehicle is transported by any water carrier authorized by the public utilities commission to transport vehicles interisland;</p>

<p>(B) The water carrier has a written agreement with the owner of the rental motor vehicle; and</p>

<p>&copy; The water carrier records and retains the information required under subsections (d) and (f).</p>

<p>For purposes of this subsection, &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; and &ldquo;rental motor vehicle&rdquo; have the same meanings as those terms are defined in section 437D-3.</p>

<p>(f) The records maintained as required by this section and all other records and receipts relating to the transportation of vehicles shall be available for inspection by the federal, state, or county law enforcement agencies, and financial institutions during normal business hours.
