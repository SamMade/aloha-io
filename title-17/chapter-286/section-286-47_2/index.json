Upon the registration of a trailer, the director of finance shall issue a certificate of registration to the owner, dealer, or manufacturer of the trailer. The certificate shall meet the following requirements: (1) It shall contain upon the face thereof, the date it was issued, the license plate number assigned to the vehicle, the vehicle identification number of the vehicle, the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle, and such description of the registered vehicle as may be required by the director of finance. If any of the information subsequently proves to be incorrect due to a typographical error, the dealer, manufacturer, or owner of the trailer shall notify the director of finance of the error by a written certificate stating the reasons for and nature of the error and the correction that should be made on the certificate of registration. Upon receipt of such notification by the director of finance, the certificate of registration shall be corrected accordingly so long as the correction does not constitute a change of the vehicle originally registered. A fee shall be paid to the director of finance for each instance of correction of the registration records. The fee charged for each instance of correction of the registration records shall be established by the county&amp;rsquo;s legislative body. (2) In addition to the requirements provided for in paragraph (1), the face of the certificate of registration shall contain endorsement lines for the transfer of interest of the registered owner of the trailer. (3) Every owner of a trailer, except for those trailers owned by a company or person operating under the jurisdiction of the public utilities commission, shall carry the certificate of registration with the trailer and shall present the certificate at the request of a police officer. This requirement to carry the certificate of registration with the trailer shall not apply when the certificate is removed for the purpose of application for renewal, transfer of registration, or to record a change in the registration. (4) The director of finance shall not issue a certificate of ownership for a trailer nor record any liens upon or legal ownership to the trailer. [L 1985, c 27, pt of ยง1] "
