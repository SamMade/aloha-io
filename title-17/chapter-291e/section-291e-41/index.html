      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Effective date, conditions, and period of administrative revocation; criteria</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง291E-41 Effective date, conditions, and period of administrative revocation; criteria.</strong> (a) Unless an administrative revocation is reversed or the temporary permit is extended by the director, administrative revocation shall become effective on the day specified in the notice of administrative revocation. Except as provided in section 291E-44.5, no license and privilege to operate a vehicle shall be restored under any circumstances during the administrative revocation period. Upon completion of the administrative revocation period, the respondent may reapply and be reissued a license pursuant to section 291E-45.</p>

<p>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (5) and in section 291E-44.5, the respondent shall keep an ignition interlock device installed and operating in any vehicle the respondent operates during the revocation period. Except as provided in section 291E-5, installation and maintenance of the ignition interlock device shall be at the respondent&rsquo;s expense. The periods of administrative revocation, with respect to a license and privilege to operate a vehicle, that shall be imposed under this part are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) A one year revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle, if the respondent&rsquo;s record shows no prior alcohol enforcement contact or drug enforcement contact during the five years preceding the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued;</p>

<p>(2) An eighteen month revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle, if the respondent&rsquo;s record shows one prior alcohol enforcement contact or drug enforcement contact during the five years preceding the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued;</p>

<p>(3) A two-year revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle, if the respondent&rsquo;s record shows two prior alcohol enforcement contacts or drug enforcement contacts during the five years preceding the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued;</p>

<p>(4) A minimum of five years up to a maximum of ten years revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle, if the respondent&rsquo;s record shows three or more prior alcohol enforcement contacts or drug enforcement contacts during the ten years preceding the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued;</p>

<p>(5) For respondents under the age of eighteen years who were arrested for a violation of section 291E-61 or 291E-61.5, revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle for the appropriate revocation period provided in paragraphs (1) to (4) or in subsection &copy;; provided that the respondent shall be prohibited from driving during the period preceding the respondent&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday and shall thereafter be subject to the ignition interlock requirement of this subsection for the balance of the revocation period; or</p>

<p>(6) For respondents, other than those excepted pursuant to section 291E-44.5&copy;, who do not install an ignition interlock device in any vehicle the respondent operates during the revocation period, revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle for the period of revocation provided in paragraphs (1) to (5) or in subsection &copy;; provided that:</p>

<p>(A) The respondent shall be absolutely prohibited from driving during the revocation period and subject to the penalties provided by section 291E-62 if the respondent drives during the revocation period; and</p>

<p>(B) The director shall not issue an ignition interlock permit to the respondent pursuant to section 291E-44.5;</p>

<p>provided that when more than one administrative revocation, suspension, or conviction arises out of the same arrest, it shall be counted as only one prior alcohol enforcement contact or drug enforcement contact, whichever revocation, suspension, or conviction occurs later.</p>

<p>&copy; If a respondent has refused to be tested after being informed:</p>

<p>(1) That the person may refuse to submit to testing in compliance with section 291E-11; and</p>

<p>(2) Of the sanctions of this part and then asked if the person still refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, in compliance with the requirements of section 291E-15,</p>

<p>the revocation imposed under subsection (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) shall be for a period of two years, three years, four years, or ten years, respectively.</p>

<p>(d) Whenever a license and privilege to operate a vehicle is administratively revoked under this part, the respondent shall be referred to the driver&rsquo;s education program for an assessment, by a certified substance abuse counselor, of the respondent&rsquo;s substance abuse or dependence and the need for treatment. The counselor shall submit a report with recommendations to the director. If the counselor&rsquo;s assessment establishes that the extent of the respondent&rsquo;s substance abuse or dependence warrants treatment, the director shall so order. All costs for assessment and treatment shall be paid by the respondent.</p>

<p>(e) Alcohol and drug enforcement contacts that occurred prior to January 1, 2002, shall be counted in determining the administrative revocation period.</p>

<p>(f) The requirement to provide proof of financial responsibility pursuant to section 287-20 shall not be based upon a revocation under subsection (b)(1). [L 2000, c 189, pt of ยง23; am L 2001, c 157, ยง21; am L 2002, c 113, ยง7; am L 2004, c 90, ยง11; am L 2006, c 64, ยง8 and c 201, ยง5; am L 2007, c 198, ยง3; am L 2008, c 171, ยง6; am L 2009, c 88, ยงยง5, 13, 17(2); am L 2010, c 166, ยง15; am L 2012, c 327, ยง17]</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Where implied consent form disclosed that defendant would be referred for substance abuse assessment and would be held responsible for the costs of that assessment and treatment, officer read the entire form to defendant, informed defendant of the consequences of refusing to take either the blood or breath test, defendant agreed to take the breath test and initialed each paragraph of the form, defendant was adequately informed of the consequences of consenting to or refusing the test and of the requirements of subsection (f) that defendant complete any substance abuse treatment as recommended by a counselor. 114 H. 396 (App.), 163 P.3d 199 (2007).</p>
