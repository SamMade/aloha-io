The counselor shall submit a report with recommendations to the director. If the counselor&amp;rsquo;s assessment establishes that the extent of the respondent&amp;rsquo;s substance abuse or dependence warrants treatment, the director shall so order. All costs for assessment and treatment shall be paid by the respondent. (e) Alcohol and drug enforcement contacts that occurred prior to January 1, 2002, shall be counted in determining the administrative revocation period.
