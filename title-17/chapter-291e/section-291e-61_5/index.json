[L 2003, c 71, §1; am L 2004, c 90, §13; am L 2005, c 194, §2; am L 2008, c 231, §18; am L 2015, c 11, §1] Case Notes An appellate court&amp;rsquo;s remand for entry of judgment of conviction and resentencing for a lesser-included offense must be based on a jurisdictionally valid lesser-included charge; where defendant&amp;rsquo;s charge under this section did not adequately allege the lesser-included offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant as a first offender under §291E-61 because the charge failed to allege an essential element, specifically, the attendant circumstance that defendant operated a vehicle on a public road, way, street, or highway, the appellate court did not err in vacating and remanding circuit court case. 126 H. 475, 273 P.3d 1161 (2012). Where, under §701-114(1)(a), proof of each element of an offense is required for a conviction, and the term &amp;ldquo;habitual&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;habitual operator&amp;rdquo; in the indictment did not convey the narrow definition that the person charged with habitually operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant had to have three or more convictions within the previous ten years, the phrase &amp;ldquo;habitual operator&amp;rdquo; did not provide adequate notice to defendant what the State was required to prove as an element of the offense; thus, defendant&amp;rsquo;s conviction vacated. 128 H. 132 (App.), 284 P.3d 905 (2012).
