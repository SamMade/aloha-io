[L 2000, c 189, pt of ยง23; am L 2001, c 157, ยง10; am L 2004, c 90, ยง2; am L 2006, c 201, ยง1; am L 2007, c 198, ยง1; am L 2008, c 171, ยง4; am L 2009, c 88, ยง13; am L 2010, c 166, ยง5; am L 2012, c 327, ยง7; am L 2016, c 231, ยง59] Case Notes Honolulu police department form 396B prohibiting operation of &amp;ldquo;a vehicle&amp;rdquo; in the event of license revocation did adequately put defendant on notice that the term &amp;ldquo;vehicle&amp;rdquo; includes mopeds and vessels, as the term &amp;ldquo;vehicle&amp;rdquo; is a term of ordinary usage and broad enough to inform a person of ordinary intelligence that it would include a means of ground transportation such as a moped. 108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109. Although the oral charge tracked the language of ยง291E-61, where the charge failed to allege that defendant was driving defendant&amp;rsquo;s vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense, the charge was deficient, as the term &amp;ldquo;operate&amp;rdquo; as defined in this section did not comport with its commonly understood definition, required the conduct to take place &amp;ldquo;upon a public way, street, road, or highway&amp;rdquo;, and was neither &amp;ldquo;unmistakable&amp;rdquo; nor &amp;ldquo;readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding&amp;rdquo;. 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009). This section establishes an attendant circumstance of the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), i.e., that the defendant&amp;rsquo;s conduct occur &amp;ldquo;upon a public way, street, road, or highway&amp;rdquo;; the definition of &amp;ldquo;operate&amp;rdquo; in this section refers generally to the conduct of &amp;ldquo;operating&amp;rdquo; a vehicle under the influence as described in the title of ยง291E-61, whether the conduct consists of driving the vehicle or otherwise assuming actual physical control of it; thus, the operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII and therefore an element of the offense. 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).
