Although the oral charge tracked the language of §291E-61, where the charge failed to allege that defendant was driving defendant&amp;rsquo;s vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense, the charge was deficient, as the term &amp;ldquo;operate&amp;rdquo; as defined in this section did not comport with its commonly understood definition, required the conduct to take place &amp;ldquo;upon a public way, street, road, or highway&amp;rdquo;, and was neither &amp;ldquo;unmistakable&amp;rdquo; nor &amp;ldquo;readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding&amp;rdquo;. 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).
