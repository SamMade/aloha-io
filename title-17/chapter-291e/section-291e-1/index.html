<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Honolulu police department form 396B prohibiting operation of &ldquo;a vehicle&rdquo; in the event of license revocation did adequately put defendant on notice that the term &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; includes mopeds and vessels, as the term &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; is a term of ordinary usage and broad enough to inform a person of ordinary intelligence that it would include a means of ground transportation such as a moped. 108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>

<p>Although the oral charge tracked the language of ยง291E-61, where the charge failed to allege that defendant was driving defendant&rsquo;s vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense, the charge was deficient, as the term &ldquo;operate&rdquo; as defined in this section did not comport with its commonly understood definition, required the conduct to take place &ldquo;upon a public way, street, road, or highway&rdquo;, and was neither &ldquo;unmistakable&rdquo; nor &ldquo;readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding&rdquo;. 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).</p>

<p>This section establishes an attendant circumstance of the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), i.e., that the defendant&rsquo;s conduct occur &ldquo;upon a public way, street, road, or highway&rdquo;; the definition of &ldquo;operate&rdquo; in this section refers generally to the conduct of &ldquo;operating&rdquo; a vehicle under the influence as described in the title of ยง291E-61, whether the conduct consists of driving the vehicle or otherwise assuming actual physical control of it; thus, the operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII and therefore an element of the offense. 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).</p>
