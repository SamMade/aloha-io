(e) If the evidence does not support administrative revocation, the director shall rescind the notice of administrative revocation and return the respondent&amp;rsquo;s license along with a certified statement that administrative revocation proceedings have been terminated. (f) If the director administratively revokes the respondent&amp;rsquo;s license and privilege to operate a vehicle, the director shall mail a written review decision to the respondent, or to the parent or guardian of the respondent if the respondent is under the age of eighteen.

(g) Failure of the respondent to request a hearing within the time provided in section 291E-38(a) shall cause the administrative revocation to take effect for the period and under the conditions provided in the administrative review decision issued by the director under this section. The respondent may regain the right to an administrative hearing by requesting the director, within sixty days of the issuance of the notice of administrative revocation as provided in section 291E-33, to schedule an administrative hearing. The administrative hearing shall be scheduled to commence no later than thirty days after the request is received by the director.
