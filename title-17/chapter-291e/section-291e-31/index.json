  "context": "PART III. ADMINISTRATIVE REVOCATION PROCESS Rules of Court See Hawaii Court Records Rules. Case Notes Administrative revocation (AR) of petitioner&amp;rsquo;s driver&amp;rsquo;s license reversed where hearing officer erred in considering the unsworn statements of the stopping officer that were included in the sworn police report of the arresting officer in determining that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop petitioner&amp;rsquo;s car. The statutory scheme reveals the legislature&amp;rsquo;s intent that sworn statements be submitted by police and other government officers playing crucial roles in the AR process and the importance the legislature placed on sworn statements by the officers as a means of ensuring the reliability of their statements and evidence used in the AR process. 130 H. 74 (App.), 305 P.3d 490 (2013).
