The director may assess and collect a $30 fee from the respondent to cover the costs of processing the respondent&amp;rsquo;s request for an administrative hearing. These costs include but shall not be limited to: the cost of photocopying documents; conditional license permits, temporary permits, and relicensing forms; interpreter services; and other similar costs; provided that the costs of issuing subpoenas for witnesses, including mileage fees, shall be borne by the party requesting the subpoena.
