The administrator shall upon request consent to the immediate cancellation of any bond or certificate of insurance, or the administrator shall return to the person entitled thereto any money or bonds deposited pursuant to this chapter as proof of financial responsibility, or the administrator shall waive the requirement of filing proof, in any of the following events: (1) At any time after three years from the date the proof was required when, during the three-year period preceding the request, the administrator has not received record of a conviction which would require or permit the suspension or revocation of the license or nonresident&amp;rsquo;s operating privilege of the person by or for whom the proof was furnished; (2) In the event of the death of the person on whose behalf the proof was filed or the permanent incapacity of the person to operate a motor vehicle; (3) In the event the person who has given proof surrenders the person&amp;rsquo;s license to the administrator; Provided, that the administrator shall not consent to the cancellation of any bond or the return of any money or bonds in the event any action for damages upon a liability covered by the proof is then pending or any judgment upon any such liability is then unsatisfied, or in the event the person who has filed the bond or deposited the money or bonds, has, within one year immediately preceding the request been involved as a driver or owner in any motor vehicle accident resulting in injury or damage to the person or property of others. An affidavit of the applicant as to the nonexistence of such facts, or that the applicant has been released from all of the applicant&amp;rsquo;s liability, or has been finally adjudicated not to be liable, for such injury or damage, shall be sufficient evidence thereof in the absence of evidence to the contrary in the records of the administrator. Whenever any person whose proof has been canceled or returned under paragraph (3) of this section applies for a license or registration within a period of three years from the date proof was originally required, any such application shall be refused unless the applicant reestablishes the proof for the remainder of the three-year period.
