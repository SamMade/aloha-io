The insurance commissioner may approve any reasonable plan for the equitable apportionment among insurance companies authorized to issue automobile liability policies in the State of applicants for such policies and for motor vehicle liability policies who are in good faith entitled to but are unable to procure such policies through ordinary methods. When any such plan has been approved after consultation with the insurance companies all insurance companies authorized to do business in the State shall subscribe thereto and participate therein. Any applicant for any such policy, any policy insured under any such plan, and any insurance company affected may appeal to the insurance commissioner from any ruling or decision of the manager or committee designated under the plan to operate the plan. Any person aggrieved by any order or act of the insurance commissioner may file an appeal therefrom either in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the first circuit, or if the appellant is a resident of any other circuit, either in the first circuit or in the circuit in which the appellant resides within thirty days after the effective date of the order or act in the same manner as is provided in section 287-2.
