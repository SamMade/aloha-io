(a) Any person in whose name more than twenty-five motor vehicles are registered may qualify as a self-insurer by obtaining a certificate of self-insurance issued by the administrator as provided in subsection (b) of this section. (b) The administrator may, in the administrator&amp;rsquo;s discretion, upon the application of such a person, issue a certificate of self-insurance when the administrator is satisfied that the person is possessed and will continue to be possessed of ability to pay judgments obtained against such person. &amp;copy; Upon not less than five days&amp;rsquo; notice and a hearing pursuant to the notice, the administrator may upon reasonable grounds cancel a certificate of self-insurance. Failure to pay any judgment within thirty days after the judgment has become final shall constitute a reasonable ground for the cancellation of a certificate of self-insurance.
