  "context": "§291C-145 Riding on roadways and bikeways. (a) Every person operating a bicycle upon a roadway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at such time shall ride as near to the right-hand curb, on the edge of the roadway, or on the shoulder off of the roadway as practicable, exercising due care when passing a standing vehicle or one proceeding in the same direction; except under any of the following situations: (1) When preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway, except where prohibited by official traffic-control devices; (2) When reasonably necessary to avoid conditions (including but not limited to fixed or moving objects, vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, animals, surface hazards, or substandard width lanes) that make it unsafe to continue along the right-hand curb, on the edge of the roadway, or on the shoulder off of the roadway. For purposes of this section, a &amp;ldquo;substandard width lane&amp;rdquo; is a lane that is too narrow for a bicycle and a vehicle to travel safely side-by-side within the lane; or (3) When a roadway is designated and signposted to carry traffic in one direction only and has two or more marked traffic lanes, a person operating a bicycle may ride as near to the left-hand curb, on the edge of the roadway, or on the shoulder off of such roadway as practicable. (b) Persons riding bicycles upon a roadway shall ride in single file; provided that where the flow of traffic is unimpeded, riding two abreast upon bicycle lanes and bicycle paths shall be permitted when such lane or path is of sufficient width to allow riding two abreast unless otherwise prohibited by rule or ordinance adopted by the director of transportation or by the counties. &amp;copy; Whenever a usable bicycle lane has been provided on a highway, any person operating a bicycle at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at such time shall ride within such bicycle lane, except that such person may move out of the lane under any of the following situations: (1) When overtaking and passing another bicycle, vehicle, or pedestrian within the lane or about to enter the lane if such overtaking and passing cannot be done safely within the lane; (2) When preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway; or (3) When reasonably necessary to leave the bicycle lane to avoid debris or other hazardous conditions. (d) No person operating a bicycle shall leave a bicycle lane until the movement can be made with reasonable safety and then only after giving an appropriate signal in the event that any vehicle may be affected by the movement. (e) No person shall operate or ride a bicycle within a bicycle lane in any direction except that permitted of vehicular traffic traveling on the same side of the highway. Upon all bicycle paths of sufficient width and providing for two-way movement of bicycle traffic, bicycles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass each other to the right. (f) The director of transportation by rule and the counties by ordinance may with respect to bikeways under their respective jurisdictions restrict or prohibit the use of such bikeways by mopeds. (g) No person shall ride a bicycle equipped with a motor on any sidewalk. The counties may, by ordinance, post bicycle lanes and bicycle paths to prevent persons riding a bicycle equipped with a motor from using them.
