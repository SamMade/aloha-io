The removal or discharge of any person from office or employment under sections 78-8 to 78-11 shall not be reviewable by any court, officer, or agency of the State or county, or any political subdivision thereof, but nothing herein shall preclude any court of competent jurisdiction from reviewing the question whether the removal or discharge is in accordance with the sections. In the case of any officer who may only be removed from office by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate of the State, the removal of the officer shall not be effected until the advice and consent of the senate thereto is given, but the duties of the comptroller or other appropriate disbursing officer hereinbefore specified shall remain the same. [L 1951, c 177, pt of §3; RL 1955, §5-6; am L 1957, c 152, §1; HRS §78-11] "
