(a) Employees shall be eligible for vacation leave, sick leave, and other leaves of absence, with or without pay, as negotiated under chapter 89 or adjusted under chapter 89C, as applicable. (b) When an employee is transferred from one department to another within the same jurisdiction or to another jurisdiction within the State, the employee shall be given credit for the vacation earned or accumulated in the department from which the employee transferred, and the director of finance of the State or the equivalent officers of the several jurisdictions shall make the appropriate transfer of funds to implement the employee transfer. Moneys received from any such transfer of funds by a state agency financed by the general fund of the State shall be deposited with the director of finance of the State to the credit of the general fund of the State; provided that, when an employee is transferred from one department to another within the same jurisdiction, the transfer of funds shall not be made if the employee&amp;rsquo;s salary is paid from the same fund. Compensation for any period of vacation allowance shall be paid at the rate to which the employee is entitled at the time the allowance is granted. &amp;copy; Upon discharge, an employee shall be entitled to all of the employee&amp;rsquo;s accumulated vacation allowance plus the employee&amp;rsquo;s current accrued vacation allowance to and including the date of discharge, notwithstanding that the current accrued vacation allowance may not have been recorded at the time. If any employee dies with accumulated or current accrued vacation earned but not taken, an amount equal to the value of the employee&amp;rsquo;s pay over the period of such earned vacation, and any earned and unpaid wages, shall be paid to the person or persons who may have been designated as the beneficiary or beneficiaries by the employee during the employee&amp;rsquo;s lifetime in a verified written statement filed with the comptroller or other disbursing officer who issues warrants or checks to pay the employee for the employee&amp;rsquo;s services as a public employee, or, failing the designation, to the employee&amp;rsquo;s estate. (d) Whenever an employee is to be discharged, voluntarily or involuntarily, the employee, at the option of the appointing authority, may be discharged and paid forthwith, in lieu of the employee&amp;rsquo;s vacation allowance, the amount of compensation to which the employee would be entitled or which the employee would be allowed during the vacation period if the employee were permitted to take the employee&amp;rsquo;s vacation in the normal manner, and in such case the employee&amp;rsquo;s position may be declared vacant and may be permanently filled by a new appointee before the expiration of any vacation period following the date of the discharge. For an employee hired after June 30, 1997, who is to be discharged, voluntarily or involuntarily, the amount of compensation to be paid in lieu of vacation allowance under this section shall be computed using the rate of pay and amount of accumulated and accrued vacation on the date the employee is discharged. Prompt notice upon such forms and in such manner as may be required shall be given by the department head of any action taken under this provision. (e) Payments of vacation allowance paid pursuant to subsections &amp;copy; or (d) shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 88D.
