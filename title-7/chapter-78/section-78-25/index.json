(a) Where an employee is absent from work because of injuries incurred within the scope of the employee&amp;rsquo;s employment and the employee is receiving workers&amp;rsquo; compensation benefits, the employee shall continue to earn vacation, sick leave, and retirement credits as though the employee were not absent but performing duties of the employee&amp;rsquo;s regular employment. Section 386-57 or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the employee shall have deducted from the employee&amp;rsquo;s workers&amp;rsquo; compensation benefit checks an amount calculated in the same manner as if the employee were not absent but performing duties of the employee&amp;rsquo;s regular employment to be used as the employee&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the retirement system. (b) An employee who is receiving workers&amp;rsquo; compensation wage loss replacement benefits may use the employee&amp;rsquo;s accumulated sick leave or vacation credits to supplement the workers&amp;rsquo; compensation wage loss replacement benefits to a sum not to exceed the employee&amp;rsquo;s regular salary.
