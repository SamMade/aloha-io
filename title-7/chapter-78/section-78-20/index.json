Whenever by any law, regulation, ordinance, rule or order of court, or any rule of any department of the state government or of any subdivision thereof, any person shall be required to give any written bond or undertaking for the performance of any contract or the provisions of any license, or for the indemnity or security of any person, party or any officer, there shall be attached to the bond or undertaking an affidavit of each of the sureties thereon, duly verified by oath, from which it shall appear that the sureties have property situate within the State subject to execution and that the sureties taken together are worth in the property the amount of the penalty specified in the bond or undertaking, over and above all of their debts and liabilities.
