      <p><strong>ยง88-96 Rights of members separated from service.</strong><a></a> (a) Any member who ceases to be an employee and who became a member before July 1, 2012, and has fewer than five years of credited service, excluding unused sick leave, or who becomes a member after June 30, 2012, and has fewer than ten years of credited service, excluding sick leave, shall, upon application to the board, be paid all of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions and the member&rsquo;s membership shall thereupon terminate and all credited service shall be forfeited; provided that a member shall not be paid the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions:</p>

<p>(1) If the member becomes an employee again within fifteen calendar days from the date the member ceased to be an employee; or</p>

<p>(2) If, at the time the application for return of accumulated contributions is received by the board, the member has become an employee again.</p>

<p>Regular interest shall be credited to the former employee&rsquo;s account until the former employee&rsquo;s accumulated contributions are returned to the former employee; provided that the former employee&rsquo;s membership shall not continue after the fourth full year following the calendar year in which the individual&rsquo;s employment terminates. Upon termination of the former employee&rsquo;s membership, the former employee&rsquo;s credited service shall be forfeited and, if the former employee&rsquo;s accumulated contributions are $1,000 or less at the time of distribution, the system shall return the former employee&rsquo;s contributions to the former employee. If the former employee does not become an employee again and if the former employee&rsquo;s accumulated contributions have not been withdrawn by the former employee or previously returned by the system to the former employee, the system shall return the former employee&rsquo;s accumulated contributions to the former employee as soon as possible after the later of: (A) the former employee attaining age sixty-two; or (B) the termination of the former employee&rsquo;s membership.</p>

<p>(b) Any member who ceases to be an employee and who became a member before July 1, 2012, and has more than five years of credited service, excluding unused sick leave, or who becomes a member after June 30, 2012, and has more than ten years of credited service, excluding sick leave, shall, upon application to the board, be paid all of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions and thereupon the former employee&rsquo;s membership shall terminate and all credited service shall be forfeited; provided that a member shall not be paid the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions:</p>

<p>(1) If the member becomes an employee again within fifteen calendar days from the date the member ceased to be an employee; or</p>

<p>(2) If, at the time the application for return of accumulated contributions is received by the board, the member has become an employee again.</p>

<p>If the contributions are not withdrawn by the former employee within four calendar years following the calendar year in which the former employee&rsquo;s employment terminates, the former employee shall have established vested benefit status and shall be eligible for the service retirement benefit in effect at the time of the former employee&rsquo;s retirement, payable in accordance with this chapter; provided that if the former employee withdraws the former employee&rsquo;s accumulated contributions, the former employee&rsquo;s vested benefit status shall terminate and all credited service shall be forfeited.</p>

<p>&copy; In case of the death of any former member after the termination of service, the former member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions shall be payable to the former member&rsquo;s estate or to such person as the former member has nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board.
