<p>(B) Is deemed permanently medically disqualified due to a service related disability to be a police officer by the employer&rsquo;s physician; and</p>

<p>(2) For a member who first earned credited service as a judge after June 30, 1999, but before July 1, 2012, for each year of credited service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service.

<p>(3) For a member who first earned credited service as a judge after June 30, 2012, for each year of credited service as a judge, three per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service.

<p>(4) For a judge with other credited service, as provided in subsection (b). If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced for age as provided in subsection (e); or</p>

<p>(5) For a judge with credited service as an elective officer or as a legislative officer, as provided in subsection (d).</p>

<p>No allowance shall exceed seventy-five per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation. If the allowance exceeds this limit, it shall be adjusted by reducing the annuity included in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) and the portion of the accumulated contributions specified in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) in excess of the requirements of the reduced annuity shall be returned to the member upon the member&rsquo;s retirement or paid to the member&rsquo;s designated beneficiary upon the member&rsquo;s death while in service or while on authorized leave without pay. The allowance for judges under this subsection, together with the retirement allowance provided by the federal government for similar service, shall in no case exceed seventy-five per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation.</p>

<p>(d) If a member, who became a member before July 1, 2012, has credited service as an elective officer or as a legislative officer, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be derived by adding the allowances computed separately under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) as follows:</p>

<p>(1) For a member who has credited service as an elective officer before July 1, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as an elective officer, three and one-half per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(1), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p>(2) For a member, who first earned credited service as an elective officer after June 30, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as an elective officer, three per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(1), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p>(3) For a member who has credited service as a legislative officer before July 1, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as a legislative officer, three and one-half per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(2), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p>(4) For a member who first earned credited service as a legislative officer after June 30, 2012, irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as a legislative officer, three per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(2), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p>(5) If the member has credited service as a judge, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be computed on the following basis:</p>

<p>(A) For a member who has credited service as a judge before July 1, 1999, irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(3), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p>(B) For a member who first earned credited service as a judge after June 30, 1999, but before July 1, 2012, and has attained the age of fifty-five, for each year of credited service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(3), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service. If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced for age as provided in subsection (e); and</p>

<p>&copy; For a member who first earned credited service as a judge after June 30, 2012, and has attained the age of sixty, for each year of credited service as a judge, three per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(3), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service. If the member has not attained age sixty, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age sixty, reduced for age as provided in subsection (i); and</p>

<p>(6) For each year of credited service not included in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), the average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(4) shall be multiplied by two per cent for credited service earned as a class A or class H member, two and one-half per cent for credited service earned as a class B member, and one and one-quarter per cent for credited service earned as a class C member. If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced for age as provided in subsection (e).</p>

<p>The total retirement allowance shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the member&rsquo;s highest average final compensation calculated under section 88-81(e)(1), (2), (3), or (4). If the allowance exceeds this limit, it shall be adjusted by reducing any annuity accrued under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) and the portion of the accumulated contributions specified in these paragraphs in excess of the requirements of the reduced annuity shall be returned to the member upon the member&rsquo;s retirement or paid to the member&rsquo;s designated beneficiary upon the member&rsquo;s death while in service or while on authorized leave without pay. If a member has service credit as an elective officer or as a legislative officer in addition to service credit as a judge, then the retirement benefit calculation contained in this subsection shall supersede the formula contained in subsection &copy;.</p>

<p>(e) Except as provided in subsections (b), &copy;, and (d), if a member, who became a member before July 1, 2012, has not attained age fifty-five at the date of retirement, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be reduced, for each month the member&rsquo;s age at the date of retirement is below age fifty-five, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) 0.4166 per cent for each month below age fifty-five and above age forty-nine and eleven months; plus</p>

<p>(2) 0.3333 per cent for each month below age fifty and above age forty-four and eleven months; plus</p>

<p>(3) 0.2500 per cent for each month below age forty-five and above age thirty-nine and eleven months; plus</p>

<p>(4) 0.1666 per cent for each month below age forty;</p>

<p>(f) If a member, who becomes a member after June 30, 2012, has attained age sixty, the member&rsquo;s maximum retirement allowance shall be one and three-fourths per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation multiplied by the total number of years of the member&rsquo;s credited service as a class A and class B member, excluding any credited service as a judge, elective officer, or legislative officer, plus a retirement allowance of one and one-fourth per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation multiplied by the total number of years of prior credited service as a class C member, plus a retirement allowance of one and three-fourths per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation multiplied by the total number of years of prior credited service as a class H member; provided that:</p>

If the allowance exceeds this limit, it shall be adjusted by reducing the annuity included in paragraph (1) and the portion of the accumulated contributions specified in paragraph (1) in excess of the requirements of the reduced annuity shall be returned to the member upon the member&rsquo;s retirement or paid to the member&rsquo;s designated beneficiary upon the member&rsquo;s death while in service or while on authorized leave without pay. The allowance for judges under this subsection, together with the retirement allowance provided by the federal government for similar service, shall in no case exceed seventy-five per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation.</p>

<p>(h) If a member, who becomes a member after June 30, 2012, has credited service as an elective officer or as a legislative officer, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be derived by adding the allowances computed separately under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as an elective officer, three per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(f)(1), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p>(2) Irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as a legislative officer, three per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(f)(2), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;</p>

<p>(3) For each year of credited service as a judge, three per cent of the member&rsquo;s average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(f)(3), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member&rsquo;s accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service. If the member has not attained age sixty, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age sixty, reduced for age as provided in subsection (i); and</p>

<p>(4) For each year of credited service not included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), the average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(f)(4) shall be multiplied by one and three-fourth per cent for credited service earned as a class A or class H member, two and one-fourth per cent for credited service earned as a class B member, and one and one-fourth per cent for credited service earned as a class C member. If the member has not attained age sixty, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age sixty, reduced for age as provided in subsection (i).</p>

<p>The total retirement allowance shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the member&rsquo;s highest average final compensation calculated under section 88-81(f)(1), (2), (3), or (4). If the allowance exceeds this limit, it shall be adjusted by reducing any annuity accrued under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) and the portion of the accumulated contributions specified in these paragraphs in excess of the requirements of the reduced annuity shall be returned to the member upon the member&rsquo;s retirement or paid to the member&rsquo;s designated beneficiary upon the member&rsquo;s death while in service or while on authorized leave without pay. If a member has service credit as an elective officer or as a legislative officer in addition to service credit as a judge, then the retirement benefit calculation contained in this subsection shall supersede the formula contained in subsection (g).</p>

<p>(i) Except as provided in subsections (f), (g), and (h), if a member, who becomes a member after June 30, 2012, has not attained age sixty at the date of retirement, the member&rsquo;s retirement allowance shall be reduced, for each month the member&rsquo;s age at the date of retirement is below age sixty, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) 0.4166 per cent for each month below age sixty and above age fifty-four and eleven months; plus</p>

<p>(2) 0.3333 per cent for each month below age fifty-five and above age forty-nine and eleven months; plus</p>

<p>(3) 0.2500 per cent for each month below age fifty and above age forty-four and eleven months; plus</p>

<p>(4) 0.1666 per cent for each month below age forty-five;</p>

<p>provided that no reduction shall be made if the member has attained the age of fifty-five and has at least twenty-five years of credited service as a firefighter, police officer, corrections officer, investigator of the department of the prosecuting attorney, investigator of the department of the attorney general, narcotics enforcement investigator, public safety investigations staff investigator, sewer worker, water safety officer, or emergency medical technician, of which the last five or more years prior to retirement is credited service in these capacities.

<p>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p>Upon retirement, a member with service as a judge or an elected officer is entitled to have each year of such service computed at the 3-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>% rate, regardless of the length of such service. Att. Gen. Op. 72-19.</p>

<p>Enhanced benefits of various law enforcement officers and firefighters, discussed. Att. Gen. Op. 90-2.</p>

<p>In general, the calculation of retirement benefits of elective officers who were elective officers on July 1, 1997, pursuant to Act 374, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997, should be made thus: the law as it existed before the effective date of Act 374 (July 1, 1997) is applied to service accrued before the effective date of the Act (i.e., elective officers can apply a high average final compensation to years of possibly multiple types of services, including elective service) and the amount derived from that calculation is added to the amount arrived at by applying the Act to service accrued after the effective date of the Act (which is segregated by service category). This results in using different average final compensations for pre- and post-Act service. Att. Gen. Op. 2000-1.</p>
