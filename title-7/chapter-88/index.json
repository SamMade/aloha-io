Reports to 2016-2020 legislature on state and county departments&amp;rsquo; and agencies&amp;rsquo; progress in complying with §88-103.7, as amended by L 2015, c 87, by July 1, 2020. L 2015, c 87, §2. Attorney General Opinions Death benefits upon an employee&amp;rsquo;s demise do not accrue to hanai children. Att. Gen. Op. 93-1. Case Notes Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over class action suit against system for alleged violations of chapter. 73 H. 9, 828 P.2d 260. Plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claim that plaintiff had earned full-time membership credit in employees&amp;rsquo; retirement system as a result of plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s service as a per diem district court judge, was at odds with specific mandates of this chapter, and to sustain it would lead to an unjust and unreasonable result. 75 H. 42, 856 P.2d 1227. While the accrual and extent of an employee&amp;rsquo;s benefits are governed by the applicable statutory provisions of this chapter, the duty of the employees&amp;rsquo; retirement system to pay accrued benefits is deemed to be contractual under article XVI, §2 of the Hawaii constitution; thus, a circuit court&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction under §661-1(1) over such claims is &amp;ldquo;founded upon contract&amp;rdquo;, as well as statute and the circuit court did not err in rejecting defendant&amp;rsquo;s contention that plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; claims were barred by sovereign immunity. 121 H. 462 (App.), 220 P.3d 1043. Respondent employees&amp;rsquo; retirement system&amp;rsquo;s (ERS) interpretation [that &amp;ldquo;compensation&amp;rdquo;, is &amp;ldquo;pay or salary that is tied to services rendered and not reimbursement for employee expenses&amp;rdquo;,] was not &amp;ldquo;palpably erroneous&amp;rdquo; given the ambiguity of the statutory language at issue and its subsequent history, the entire statutory scheme, and respondent ERS&amp;rsquo; long-standing interpretation and consistent practice to exclude car, uniform, and firearm allowances from its definition and calculation of &amp;ldquo;compensation&amp;rdquo;, and was entitled to persuasive weight. 129 H. 107 (App.), 295 P.3d 977 (2013).
