(a) Upon retirement, any member may elect to receive the maximum retirement allowance to which the member is entitled computed in accordance with section 88-74, 88-76, or 88-80, and in the event of the retirant&amp;rsquo;s death, there shall be paid to the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary, or otherwise to the retirant&amp;rsquo;s estate the difference between: (1) The balance of the member&amp;rsquo;s accumulated contributions at the time of the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement; and (2) The retirement allowance and, if the retirant retired after November 30, 2004, the post retirement allowances paid or payable to the retirant prior to death. In lieu of this maximum allowance, the member may elect to receive the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement allowance under any one of the optional plans described below, which shall be actuarially equivalent to the maximum allowance. Option 1: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member&amp;rsquo;s lifetime. At the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement, there shall be established an amount of initial insurance that shall be computed on the basis of actuarial factors adopted by the board. Upon the death of the retirant, there shall be paid to the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary, otherwise to the retirant&amp;rsquo;s estate: any balance remaining in the initial insurance reserve, after deducting the retirement allowance and, if the retirant retired after November 30, 2004, the post retirement allowances paid to the retirant prior to death. In lieu of the lump sum balance, the beneficiary may, if the beneficiary is a natural person, elect to receive an allowance for life based on the value of the balance; provided that the allowance is not less than $100 per month. If the beneficiary of the retirant who: (1) Retired after November 30, 2004, and (2) Dies after June 30, 2007, elects to receive the allowance in lieu of the lump sum balance, there shall also be payable to the beneficiary an additional allowance calculated and payable in the same manner as a post retirement allowance under section 88-90. The additional allowance shall be based on the original amount of the allowance in lieu of the lump sum balance, and shall commence on the first day of July following the calendar year in which payment of the allowance in lieu of the lump sum balance is effective. Option 2: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member&amp;rsquo;s lifetime and have those allowances, including cumulative post retirement allowances, if applicable, continued after the member&amp;rsquo;s death to the member&amp;rsquo;s beneficiary designated at the time of the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement, for the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies prior to the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant; provided that for members retiring after November 30, 2004, if the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary dies at any time after the retirant retired, but before the death of the retirant, the retirant, upon the death of the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary, shall receive a retirement allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, calculated as if the retirant had selected the maximum retirement allowance to which the retirant is entitled. Only one beneficiary shall be designated under this option. The beneficiary designated under this option shall be a natural person, and benefits under this option shall only be paid to a natural person. Option 3: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member&amp;rsquo;s lifetime and have one-half of the allowance, including fifty per cent of all cumulative post retirement allowances, if applicable, continued after the member&amp;rsquo;s death to the member&amp;rsquo;s beneficiary designated at the time of the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement, for the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies prior to the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant; provided that for members retiring after November 30, 2004, if the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary dies at any time after the retirant retired, but before the death of the retirant, the retirant, upon the death of the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary, shall receive a retirement allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, calculated as if the retirant had selected the maximum retirement allowance to which the retirant is entitled. Only one beneficiary shall be designated under this option. The beneficiary designated under this option shall be a natural person, and benefits under this option shall only be paid to a natural person. Option 4: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member&amp;rsquo;s lifetime and provide some other benefit to the member&amp;rsquo;s beneficiary in accordance with the member&amp;rsquo;s own specification; provided that this election shall be certified by the actuary to be the actuarial equivalent of the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement allowance and shall be approved by the board. Option 5: The member may elect to receive the balance of the member&amp;rsquo;s accumulated contributions at the time of retirement in a lump sum and, during the member&amp;rsquo;s lifetime, a retirement allowance equal to the maximum retirement allowance reduced by the actuarial equivalent of these contributions. Upon the death of the retirant, all further payments shall cease. Only a member retiring from service having at least ten years of credited service or for disability may elect this retirement allowance option. To receive benefits, the beneficiary must have been designated by the member in the form and manner prescribed by the board. (b) In the event of the death of a member after the date of the filing of the member&amp;rsquo;s written application to retire but prior to the retirement date designated by the member, and, if the member was eligible to retire on the date of the member&amp;rsquo;s death, the member&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary, or otherwise the personal representative of the member&amp;rsquo;s estate, may elect to receive either the death benefit under section 88-84 or the allowance under the option selected by the member that would have been payable had the member retired. The effective date of the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement shall be the first day of a month, except for the month of December when the effective date of retirement may be on the first or last day of the month, and shall be no earlier than the later of thirty days from the date the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement application was filed or the day following the member&amp;rsquo;s date of death. The election may not be made if, at the time of the member&amp;rsquo;s death, there are individuals who are eligible to receive death benefits under section 88-85 who have made a claim for the benefits; provided that, if the designated beneficiary is an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 88-85, the designated beneficiary may receive benefits pursuant to an election made under this section pending disposition of the claim for benefits under section 88-85. If death benefits are payable under section 88-85, the death benefits shall be in lieu of any benefits payable pursuant to this section. &amp;copy; No election by a member under this section shall take effect unless: (1) The spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of the member is furnished written notification that: (A) Specifies the retirement date, the benefit option selected, and the beneficiary designated by the member; (B) Provides information indicating the effect of the election; and &amp;copy; Is determined adequate by rules adopted by the board in accordance with chapter 91; (2) The member selects option 2 or option 3 and designates the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary as the beneficiary; or (3) It is established to the satisfaction of the board that the notice required under paragraph (1) cannot be provided because: (A) There is no spouse or reciprocal beneficiary; (B) The spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be located; &amp;copy; The member has failed to notify the system that the member has a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or has failed to provide the system with the name and address of the member&amp;rsquo;s spouse or reciprocal beneficiary; or (D) Of other reasons, as established by board rules adopted in accordance with chapter 91. Any notice provided to a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or determination that the notification of a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be provided, shall be effective only with respect to that spouse or reciprocal beneficiary. The system will rely upon the representations made by a member as to whether the member has a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary and the name and address of the member&amp;rsquo;s spouse or reciprocal beneficiary. (d) Each member, within a reasonable period of time before the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement date, shall be provided a written explanation of: (1) The terms and conditions of the various benefit options; (2) The rights of the member&amp;rsquo;s spouse or reciprocal beneficiary under subsection &amp;copy; to be notified of the member&amp;rsquo;s election of a benefit option; and (3) The member&amp;rsquo;s right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election of a benefit option. (e) The system shall not be liable for any false statements made to the system by the member or by the member&amp;rsquo;s employer. (f) In the event of the death of the retirant within one year after the date of retirement, the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary may elect to receive either the death benefit under the retirement allowance option selected by the retirant, or the benefit that would have been paid under section 88-84 had the retirant died immediately prior to retirement, less any payments received by the retirant; provided that the designated beneficiary may not elect to receive benefits under option 2 of this section if the retirant would not have been permitted by applicable law or by the rules of the board to name the designated beneficiary as beneficiary under option 2. (g) The increase in the retirant&amp;rsquo;s benefit under options 2, 3, and, if applicable, 4 upon the death of the retirant&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary shall be effective the first day of the month following the date of death of the designated beneficiary. The retirant shall notify the system in writing and provide a certified copy of the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s death certificate. The system shall make retroactive benefit payments to the retirant, not to exceed six months from the date the written notification and the certified copy of the death certificate are received by the system. The retroactive payments shall be without interest. (h) Upon a member&amp;rsquo;s retirement: (1) The member&amp;rsquo;s election of a retirement allowance option shall be irrevocable; and (2) The member&amp;rsquo;s designation of a beneficiary shall be irrevocable if the retirement allowance option elected by the member is: (A) Option 2 or 3; (B) An option that includes option 2 or 3 in combination with some other form of benefit payment; or &amp;copy; Any other option for which the actuarial equivalent of the option to the maximum retirement allowance is determined at the time of the member&amp;rsquo;s retirement based in whole or in part on the age of the member&amp;rsquo;s designated beneficiary. (i) A claim under this section by a retirant&amp;rsquo;s or member&amp;rsquo;s beneficiary for benefits upon the death of a retirant or member shall be filed no later than three years from the date of the retirant&amp;rsquo;s or member&amp;rsquo;s death.
