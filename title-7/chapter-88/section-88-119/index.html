<p>&copy; Obligations for the repayment of home loans made under the Servicemen&rsquo;s Readjustment Act of 1944 or under Title II of the National Housing Act;</p>

<p>(D) Other obligations secured by first mortgages on unencumbered improved real estate owned in fee simple; provided that the amount of the obligation at the time investment is made therein shall not exceed eighty per cent of the value of the real estate and improvements mortgaged to secure it, and except that the amount of the obligation at the time investment is made therein may exceed eighty per cent but no more than ninety per cent of the value of the real estate and improvements mortgaged to secure it; provided further that the obligation is insured or guaranteed against default or loss under a mortgage insurance policy issued by a casualty insurance company licensed to do business in the State. The coverage provided by the insurer shall be sufficient to reduce the system&rsquo;s exposure to not more than eighty per cent of the value of the real estate and improvements mortgaged to secure it. The insurance coverage shall remain in force until the principal amount of the obligation is reduced to eighty per cent of the market value of the real estate and improvements mortgaged to secure it, at which time the coverage shall be subject to cancellation solely at the option of the board. Real estate shall not be deemed to be encumbered within the meaning of this subparagraph by reason of the existence of any of the restrictions, charges, or claims described in section 431:6-308;</p>

<p>(E) Other obligations secured by first mortgages of leasehold interests in improved real estate; provided that:</p>

<p>(ii) The amount of the obligation at the time investment is made therein shall not exceed eighty per cent of the value of the respective leasehold interest and improvements, and except that the amount of the obligation at the time investment is made therein may exceed eighty per cent but no more than ninety per cent of the value of the leasehold interest and improvements mortgaged to secure it;</p>

<p>provided further that the obligation is insured or guaranteed against default or loss under a mortgage insurance policy issued by a casualty insurance company licensed to do business in the State. The coverage provided by the insurer shall be sufficient to reduce the system&rsquo;s exposure to not more than eighty per cent of the value of the leasehold interest and improvements mortgaged to secure it. The insurance coverage shall remain in force until the principal amount of the obligation is reduced to eighty per cent of the market value of the leasehold interest and improvements mortgaged to secure it, at which time the coverage shall be subject to cancellation solely at the option of the board;</p>

<p>(F) Obligations for the repayment of home loans guaranteed by the department of Hawaiian home lands pursuant to section 214(b) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920; and</p>

<p>(G) Obligations secured by second mortgages on improved real estate for which the mortgagor procures a second mortgage on the improved real estate for the purpose of acquiring the leaseholder&rsquo;s fee simple interest in the improved real estate; provided that any prior mortgage shall not contain provisions that might jeopardize the security position of the retirement system or the borrower&rsquo;s ability to repay the mortgage loan.</p>

<p>The board may retain or dispose of the real estate, including leasehold interests therein, as it may acquire by foreclosure of mortgages or in enforcement of security, or as may be conveyed to it in satisfaction of debts previously contracted in the same manner as other investments in interest in real property authorized by this section;</p>

<p>(11) Private placements. Investments in institutional blind pool limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or direct investments that make private debt and equity investments in privately held companies, including but not limited to investments in Hawaii high technology businesses or venture capital investments that, in the informed opinion of the board, are appropriate to invest funds of the system. In evaluating venture capital investments, the board shall consider, among other things, the impact an investment may have on job creation in Hawaii and on the state economy. The board shall report annually to the legislature on any Hawaii venture capital investments it has made; provided that if the board determines it is not prudent to invest in any Hawaii venture capital investments the board shall report the rationale for the decision. The board, by January 1, 2008, shall develop criteria to determine the amount of funds that may be prudently invested in Hawaii private placement investments.
