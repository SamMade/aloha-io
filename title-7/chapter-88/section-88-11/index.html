<p>The bonus amounts payable under this paragraph shall be based on years of retirement and shall be a cumulative amount to include all previous bonuses and shall not exceed:</p>

<p>(B) $2.50 for each year of the retirant&rsquo;s or pensioner&rsquo;s credited service if the retirant or pensioner has been retired a minimum of ten years by July 1 in the year in which the bonus is effective;</p>

<p>For the purposes of this paragraph, if the retirant or pensioner had retired, returned to service, and again retired, the latest retirement date shall be considered as the date of retirement; and</p>

<p>(12) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in fiscal year 2002-2003, each state and county retiree who is seventy years of age and older with at least twenty years of credited service as of June 30, 2002, shall receive a one time, lump sum bonus of $200.
