<p>(11) Any other provision to the contrary notwithstanding, effective July 1, 1990, and each July 1, thereafter until June 30, 1999, bonuses shall be paid to retirants and pensioners with ten or more years of service or to their beneficiaries who are receiving a monthly benefit from the system, in accordance with this paragraph; provided that the requirement of ten or more years of service shall not apply in the case of a person who retires with less than ten years of service because of a service connected disability; and provided further that if the retirant or pensioner is currently receiving a larger bonus than what would be payable under this paragraph the retirant or pensioner shall continue to receive the bonus amount received on June 30, 1990, until the retirant&rsquo;s or pensioner&rsquo;s bonus calculated under this paragraph exceeds the June 30, 1990, bonus amount at which time the difference between the June 30, 1990, bonus and the bonus calculated under this paragraph would be payable.</p>

<p>The bonus amounts payable under this paragraph shall be based on years of retirement and shall be a cumulative amount to include all previous bonuses and shall not exceed:</p>

<p>(A) $1.25 for each year of the retirant&rsquo;s or pensioner&rsquo;s credited service if the retirant or pensioner has been retired a minimum of five years by July 1 in the year in which the bonus is effective;</p>

<p>(B) $2.50 for each year of the retirant&rsquo;s or pensioner&rsquo;s credited service if the retirant or pensioner has been retired a minimum of ten years by July 1 in the year in which the bonus is effective;</p>

<p>For the purposes of this paragraph, if the retirant or pensioner had retired, returned to service, and again retired, the latest retirement date shall be considered as the date of retirement; and</p>

<p>(12) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in fiscal year 2002-2003, each state and county retiree who is seventy years of age and older with at least twenty years of credited service as of June 30, 2002, shall receive a one time, lump sum bonus of $200.
