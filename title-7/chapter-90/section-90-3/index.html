<p>(12) Provide written guidelines governing the recruitment, screening, utilization, and supervision of volunteers.</p>

<p>(13) Recognize an applicant&rsquo;s prior volunteer service in evaluating fulfillment of training and experience requirements for state employment pursuant to rules adopted by the department of human resources development, the judiciary, and the board of regents of the University of Hawaii.</p>
