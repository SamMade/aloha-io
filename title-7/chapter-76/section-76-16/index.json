The director shall determine the applicability of this section to specific positions. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the civil service status of any incumbent as it existed on July 1, 1955. &amp;copy; No position shall be exempted from civil service recruitment procedures unless it is in accordance with this section. In addition to the exemptions under subsection (b), sections 46-33 and 76-77, or other law, the director may exempt additional positions if the reason for exempting the position is for the same reason as a position that is included in the list of exemptions for the respective jurisdiction. (d) The director may provide for an exemption from civil service recruitment procedures if the appointment to the position has a limitation date and it would be impracticable to recruit under civil service recruitment procedures because the required probation period that is part of the examination process cannot be completed by the limitation date. The rules shall not permit additional exemptions from civil service recruitment procedures for the same position when the position will be filled for a duration that would be sufficient to recruit under civil service recruitment procedures and allow for completion of the required probation period. (e) It is also the public policy of the State that all civil service positions be covered under the classification systems of the jurisdictions, unless the position was exempted from the classification systems by law prior to July 1, 2002 or based on reasons set forth in rules. The rules may include reasons for a temporary exemption of a position, such as the establishment of a new class is pending, or for a permanent exemption when the establishment of a class is impracticable. (f) The exemption of a position from the classification systems, whether temporary or permanent, or an appointment with a limitation date shall not itself result in an exemption from civil service recruitment procedures. Civil service recruitment procedures based on merit shall be followed for all positions unless exempted under subsection (b), &amp;copy;, or (d). Applicants referred under civil service recruitment procedures shall be informed if the appointment has a limitation date or if the position is temporarily or permanently exempted from the classification systems. (g) Each director shall be responsible for ensuring that all exemptions from civil service recruitment procedures or from the classification systems are consistent with this section. With respect to positions exempted under this section prior to July 1, 2002 by any other law, the director shall review these positions to determine whether the positions should continue to be exempt and if so, whether from civil service recruitment procedures or the classification systems, or both. If the director determines that a position should no longer be exempt from either or both based on the intent of this section, the director shall consult with the appropriate appointing authority and its chief executive on removing the exemptions. With the approval of the chief executive, the director shall take whatever action is necessary to remove the exemptions, including submittal of proposed legislation to remove the exemptions. (h) The director shall establish rules to implement this section that shall be in accordance with the following: (1) Whenever a position exempted under subsection (b) or &amp;copy; is no longer exempted from the civil service, normal civil service recruitment procedures shall apply, unless the incumbent is to be retained without the necessity for examination by action of the legislature; provided that in such event, the incumbent shall be retained, but only if the incumbent meets the minimum qualification requirements of the position; and (2) The manner for setting the compensation of incumbents upon their inclusion in the classification systems shall be fair and equitable in comparison to the compensation of other incumbents with comparable experience in the same or essentially similar classes; provided that the compensation of incumbents who are in the same bargaining unit, prior to and after their inclusion in the classification systems, shall be in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement. (i) Employees in positions subject to civil service recruitment procedures shall be entitled to become and remain members of the civil service for the duration of their appointments as provided in section 76-27. Employees in positions exempted from civil service recruitment procedures shall not be entitled to membership in the civil service. (j) Employees in positions that are exempted from the classification plan, whether temporarily or permanently, may be entitled to membership in the civil service as provided in subsection (i).
