(a) Each employee-beneficiary shall make a monthly contribution to the fund amounting to the difference between the monthly charge of the health benefits plan selected by the employee-beneficiary and the contribution made by the State or county for the employee-beneficiary to the fund. Nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee-beneficiary from participating in a cafeteria plan authorized under Title 26 United States Code section 125, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and section 78-30. (b) During the period the health benefits plan selected by an employee-beneficiary is in effect, the employee-beneficiary, if allowed by law, shall authorize the employee-beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s contribution to be withheld and transmitted to the fund monthly by the comptroller, employees&amp;rsquo; retirement system, or finance officer who disburses the employee-beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s compensation, pension, or retirement pay. If an employee-beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the fund is not withheld and transmitted to the fund, the employee-beneficiary shall pay the monthly contribution: (1) In the case of an employee-beneficiary who normally receives the employee-beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s compensation from the comptroller or employees&amp;rsquo; retirement system, directly to the fund by the first day of each month; or (2) In the case of all other employee-beneficiaries, to the respective finance officer from whom the employee-beneficiary normally receives compensation for transmittal to the fund by the first day of each month. &amp;copy; Notwithstanding subsection (a), an employee-beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s monthly contribution to the fund shall include the amount that would have been the employee-beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s contribution if the employee-beneficiary had not elected to participate in the cafeteria plan.
