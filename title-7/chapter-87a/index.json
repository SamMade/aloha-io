L 2016, c 204, §6; (2) Nondiscrimination provisions required by L 2016, c 135. L 2016, c 135, §5; (3) Reimbursement for prescription contraceptive supplies required by L 2016, c 205. L 2016, c 205, §4; and (4) Requirement for reimbursement for telehealth services by L 2016, c 226. L 2016, c 226, §13. Cross References Hawaii health authority, see chapter 322H. Health and dental insurance data; mandatory reporting for certain insurers, see §323D-18.5. Prescription drug benefits, see chapter 431R. Case Notes This chapter&amp;rsquo;s use of general trust language does not impose upon the trustees all of the common law fiduciary duties; although this chapter does not use &amp;ldquo;discretion&amp;rdquo; in requiring the board to decide upon the structure of the health benefits plan, the legislature clearly intended that the board have broad discretion in its design; where trustees expressed concern regarding the impact a change to a three- or four-tier structure would have on the collective bargaining process, and also determined that the two-tiered structure would have a negative impact on the smallest percentage of plan participants, trustees did not abuse their discretion. 115 H. 126, 165 P.3d 1027. The words &amp;ldquo;similarly situated beneficiary not eligible for medicare&amp;rdquo;, as those words are used in §87A-23(1), or &amp;ldquo;similarly situated employee-beneficiary not eligible for medicare&amp;rdquo;, as those words are used in §87A-23(3), invoke a comparison between medicare eligible retirees and retirees who do not qualify for medicare; thus, this chapter does not require the board of the employer-union health benefits trust fund to provide health benefits plans to retirees whose benefits &amp;ldquo;reasonably approximate&amp;rdquo; those benefits provided to active employees. 122 H. 402, 228 P.3d 282.
