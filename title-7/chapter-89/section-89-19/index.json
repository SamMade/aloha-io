Although an application of §84-13 was necessary to decide the union&amp;rsquo;s complaint under §89-13, it could not be said that the question arose under chapter 84; where union filed the complaint with the board under this section, the board had &amp;ldquo;exclusive original jurisdiction&amp;rdquo; to determine prohibited practice complaints and the ethics commission would not have had jurisdiction to make that determination; thus, the board had the power to apply §84-13 in order to decide whether a prohibited practice violation actually occurred and it did not exceed its jurisdiction in ruling that a violation did not occur based on the application of §84-13. 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.
