  "context": "[ยง89-10.8] Resolution of disputes; grievances. (a) A public employer shall enter into written agreement with the exclusive representative setting forth a grievance procedure culminating in a final and binding decision, to be invoked in the event of any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of a written agreement. The grievance procedure shall be valid and enforceable and shall be consistent with the following: (1) A dispute over the terms of an initial or renewed agreement shall not constitute a grievance; (2) No employee in a position exempted from chapter 76, who serves at the pleasure of the appointing authority, shall be allowed to grieve a suspension or discharge unless the collective bargaining agreement specifically provides otherwise; and (3) With respect to any adverse action resulting from an employee&amp;rsquo;s failure to meet performance requirements of the employee&amp;rsquo;s position, the grievance procedure shall provide that the final and binding decision shall be made by a performance judge as provided in this section. (b) The performance judge shall be a neutral third party selected from a list of persons whom the parties have mutually agreed are eligible to serve as a performance judge for the duration of the collective bargaining agreement. The parties, by mutual agreement, may modify the performance judge list at any time and shall determine a process for selection from the list. &amp;copy; The performance judge shall use the conditions in section 76-41(b) as tests in reaching a decision on whether the employer&amp;rsquo;s action, based on a failure by the employee to meet the performance requirements of the employee&amp;rsquo;s position, was with or without merit. (d) If it is alleged that the adverse action was not due to a failure to meet performance requirements but for disciplinary reasons without just and proper cause, the performance judge shall first proceed with a determination on the merits of the employer&amp;rsquo;s action under subsection &amp;copy;. If the performance judge determines that the adverse action may be based on reasons other than a failure to meet performance requirements, the performance judge shall then determine, based on appropriate standards of review, whether the disciplinary action was with or without proper cause and render a final and binding decision. [L 2000, c 253, ยง91] Case Notes Where the parties explicitly agreed to leave all questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator, the intermediate court of appeals erred in stating that, pursuant to the parties&amp;rsquo; agreements and this section, the circuit court may only order arbitration after finding that a grievance exists. 132 H. 426, 322 P.3d 966 (2014).
