  "context": "Rule 102.1 Effect of commentary. The commentary to these rules when published may be used as an aid in understanding the rules, but not as evidence of legislative intent. [L 1980, c 164, pt of ยง1] RULE 102.1 COMMENTARY This rule has no Fed. R. Evid. counterpart. It closely resembles Hawaii Rev. Stat. ยง701-105 (1976), which limits the effect of the penal code commentary because, as the commentary to that section points out, &amp;ldquo;of the strong judicial deference given legislative committee reports and other evidence of legislative intent authored by the Legislature or its staff.&amp;rdquo; See State v. Aiu, 59 H. 92, 98, 576 P.2d 1044, 1049 (1978); State v. Anderson, 58 H. 479, 483, 572 P.2d 159, 162 (1977); State v. Alo, 57 H. 418, 426-27, 558 P.2d 1012, 1017 (1976); State v. Nobriga, 56 H. 75, 77, 527 P.2d 1269, 1273 (1974). "
