(a) To receive federal aid, assistance, support, benefits, services, and interests in or rights to use federal property, a state agency may agree in writing to an indemnity provision by which the State agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless a United States agency, its officers, agents, and employees when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) Federal law expressly or by clear implication requires the indemnity provision; (2) The governor, following a favorable review by the department of the attorney general, approves the State&amp;rsquo;s proposed indemnification; and (3) The comptroller, pursuant to chapter 41D, has obtained an insurance policy or policies in an amount sufficient to cover the liability of the State that reasonably may be anticipated to arise under the indemnity provision or has determined that it is not in the best interest of the State to obtain insurance. (b) An indemnity provision not in strict compliance with this section shall not give rise to a claim against the State under chapter 661 or otherwise waive the State&amp;rsquo;s sovereign immunity. &amp;copy; This section shall not affect sections 201H-152(b)(2), 212-7, or 523A-64.
