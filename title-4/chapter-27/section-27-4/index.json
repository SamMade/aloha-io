No offense committed and no penalty or forfeiture incurred under the laws of the State or any county ordinance or rule or regulation shall be affected by the assignment of functions to the State by this chapter; provided that whenever any punishment, penalty, or forfeiture is mitigated by any provision of this chapter, such provision may be extended and applied to any judgment pronounced after May 29, 1965. No suit or prosecution, pending at the time this chapter takes effect, shall be affected by this chapter. The right of any administrative officer of the county to institute proceedings for prosecution for an offense or any action to recover a penalty or forfeiture shall henceforth be vested in the head of the state department to which the function has been assigned by the governor or some person designated by the head of the department or the governor or as may be otherwise directed by law. The right of appeal from administrative actions or determinations as provided by law shall not be impaired by this chapter. Whenever a right of appeal from administrative actions or determinations is provided by law to any county for functions which are assigned to the State, the right of appeal shall lie to or from the state department to which the assignment of function has been made. The right of appeal shall exist to the same extent and in accordance with the procedure as immediately prior to July 1, 1965. [L 1965, c 97, §6; Supp, §14B-5; HRS §27-4] "
