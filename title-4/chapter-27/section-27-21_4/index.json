The several counties shall convey to the State all of their respective interests in and to any real property and the improvements used in the functional areas covered by section 27-21.1 and which are directly related to and necessary for the operation and maintenance thereof. The conveyances shall be without cost to the State or reimbursement to the county, and without compliance with disposal procedures or requirements, any law to the contrary notwithstanding. If within a period of ten years after January 1, 1970, any of the real property so transferred is abandoned or ceases to be used for purpose stated in the preceding paragraph, the board of land and natural resources shall by resolution declaring such abandonment or cessation as to any of the real property conveyed hereunder or any portion thereof, reconvey such realty or portion to the county from which it had originally been transferred. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to state lands that had been set aside for use by the county, or to real property where the major portion of the cost of the land or improvements was financed by state funds. [L 1969, c 265, §4] Note Section 27-21.1 referred to in text is repealed. Revision Note &amp;ldquo;January 1, 1970&amp;rdquo; substituted for &amp;ldquo;the effective date of this Act&amp;rdquo;. "
