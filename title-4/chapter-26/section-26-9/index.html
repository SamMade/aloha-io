The moneys in the fund may be used to train personnel as the director deems necessary and for any other activity related to compliance resolution.</p>

<p>A separate special subaccount of the compliance resolution fund, to be known as the post-secondary education authorization special subaccount, shall be established for fees collected by the department of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to chapter 305J. The special subaccount shall be governed by section 305J-19.</p>

<p>As used in this subsection, unless otherwise required by the context, &ldquo;compliance resolution&rdquo; means a determination of whether:</p>

<p>(p) Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, the department of commerce and consumer affairs, or any board or commission placed within it for administrative purposes, may contract with professional testing services to prepare, administer, and grade examinations and tests for license applicants. For these purposes, the department may require applicants to pay the examination fee directly to the testing agency.</p>

<p>(q) Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, when any type of bond or insurance required to be maintained by any licensee under a regulatory program of the department of commerce and consumer affairs, or of any board or commission assigned to the department of commerce and consumer affairs, cannot reasonably be secured, the department, board, or commission may provide by rule for alternative forms of security to the consumer so long as that alternate security is no less than that provided by the type of bond or insurance initially required.</p>

<p>&reg; Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the department of commerce and consumer affairs, or any board or commission placed within it for administrative purposes, may change any license renewal date by rules adopted in accordance with chapter 91.</p>

<p>(s) The director of commerce and consumer affairs may establish advisory committees, the members of which shall serve as consultants to the boards and to the director in their review of licensees referred for possible disciplinary action and as experts to the department for investigations and professional vocational licensing matters. Each advisory committee shall be appointed by the director from a list of licensees submitted annually by the board or by referral from the regulated industry for which an advisory committee is appointed. Each member of the committee shall serve until a new committee is established or until the particular case for which the member was designated a consultant or expert has been concluded.</p>

<p>All members of the advisory committee shall serve voluntarily and without compensation, but shall be paid reasonable allowances for travel and expenses that may be incurred as a result of performance of their duties on the committee. The costs shall be paid by the department.</p>

<p>Any member of the advisory committee shall be immune from civil liability for any act done in connection with this subsection.
