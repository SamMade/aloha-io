<p>Any depository financial services loan company acquiring any real property in any manner other than provided by this section immediately, upon receiving notice from the commissioner, shall charge the same to profit and loss, or otherwise remove the same from the assets, and when any loss impairs the capital and surplus of the depository financial services loan company, the impairment shall be made good in the manner provided in this chapter.</p>
