It shall be lawful for any financial institution to refuse to pay any check, draft, order of transfer or withdrawal, or order drawn upon it when the officers or employees of the financial institution in good faith have reason to believe that the person signing or indorsing the instrument is or was so under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other intoxicating substances as to make it doubtful whether the person is or was at the time of signing or indorsing the instrument capable of intelligently transacting business; and no action at law or equity may be maintained against the financial institution or its officers or employees on account of any refusal pursuant to this section.
