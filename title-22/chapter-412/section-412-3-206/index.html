      <p><strong>ยง412:3-206 Grant of preliminary approval to organize a financial institution.</strong> (a) Following the expiration of the time for the submission of written comments or the completion of an informational and comment proceeding, the commissioner shall issue a written decision and order on the application for preliminary approval to organize. If the commissioner approves the application, the applicant shall become an &ldquo;applicant in organization&rdquo;, and may take all steps necessary to complete organization and file an application for a charter or license.</p>

<p>(b) An application for preliminary approval to organize shall be approved only if the commissioner finds that:</p>

<p>(1) The proposed activities of the financial institution will comply with the requirements of this chapter;</p>

<p>(2) If the financial institution will be a subsidiary of a holding company, the holding company is or will be properly organized, in good standing, and financially sound, and is not or will not be engaging directly or indirectly through any subsidiary or affiliate in business prohibited by this chapter;</p>

<p>(3) The qualifications, character, financial responsibility, experience, and general fitness of the proposed directors and executive officers of the financial institution and any holding company are such as will warrant public confidence and a belief that the business of the financial institution will be honestly and efficiently conducted. For purposes of this section, the commissioner may presume that in the absence of credible evidence to the contrary, a director, officer, or controlling person is of good character and sound financial standing. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, including without limitation a finding that the director, officer, or controlling person has:</p>

<p>(A) Been convicted of, or has pleaded nolo contendere to, any crime involving an act of fraud or dishonesty;</p>

<p>(B) Consented to or suffered a judgment in any civil action based upon conduct involving an act of fraud or dishonesty;</p>

<p>&copy; Consented to or suffered the suspension or revocation of any professional, occupational, or vocational license based upon conduct involving an act of fraud or dishonesty;</p>

<p>(D) Wilfully made or caused to be made in any application or report filed with the commissioner, or in any proceeding before the commissioner, any statement that was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or has wilfully omitted to state in any application or report any material fact that was required to be stated therein; or</p>

<p>(E) Wilfully committed any violation of, or has wilfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured the violation by any other person of, any provision of this chapter or of any rule or order issued under this chapter;</p>

<p>(4) The proposed operations of the financial institution will be conducted in a safe and sound manner;</p>

<p>(5) The articles of incorporation of the financial institution comply in all respects with this chapter and chapter 414; and</p>

<p>(6) The capital stock solicitation submission is complete and the solicitation will not affect the safety or soundness of the proposed financial institution or harm the public interest.</p>

<p>&copy; In granting preliminary approval to organize, the commissioner may impose any conditions and restrictions that are in the public interest, including but not limited to requiring the applicant to fulfill representations contained in its application and agreements made with the commissioner during the application process.</p>

<p>(d) Upon the issuance of a written decision and order granting the application for preliminary approval to organize, the articles of incorporation may be delivered by the applicant in organization to the director of commerce and consumer affairs for filing and, if accepted for filing, the financial institution shall have corporate existence. Although the proposed financial institution may have corporate existence, it may not transact any financial institution business until it has received a financial institution charter or license under this article; provided that the financial institution may conduct any transaction that is incidental and necessary to prepare to do a financial institution business and obtain a charter or license.</p>

<p>(e) The applicant and the proposed Hawaii financial institution shall not solicit subscriptions for the capital stock of the Hawaii financial institution until the written decision and order granting the application for preliminary approval to organize has been issued and the articles of incorporation have been accepted for filing by the director of commerce and consumer affairs. The approval shall not constitute a determination that the applicant has complied with chapter 485A or any other state or federal law.
