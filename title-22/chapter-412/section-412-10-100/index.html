      <p><strong>ARTICLE 10. CREDIT UNIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>ยง412:10-100 Definitions.</strong> The following definitions shall apply in construing this article unless such application would produce a result clearly inconsistent with the context of the statutory provision:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital&rdquo; means share accounts, membership shares, reserves and undivided earnings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Common bond&rdquo; means persons or groups of persons, including members of the immediate family of persons within such groups, having a similar profession or occupation, being members of the same industry or trade, belonging to the same trade union; being members of the same association, club, or other organization; residing within an identifiable neighborhood, community, rural district, or county; being employed by a common employer; or being employed by the credit union.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corporate credit union&rdquo; means a credit union whose field of membership consists primarily of other credit unions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Credit union&rdquo; means a cooperative, nonprofit association, chartered under this chapter for the purposes of encouraging thrift among its members, creating a source of credit at a fair and reasonable rate of interest, and providing an opportunity for its members to use and control their own money to improve their economic and social condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Credit union service organization&rdquo; means any organization which is established primarily to serve the needs of its member credit unions, and whose business relates to the daily operations of the credit unions it serves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deposit account&rdquo; means a balance held by a credit union and established by a member, another credit union or a governmental unit in accordance with standards established by the board of directors of the credit union including balances designated as deposits, deposit certificates, checking accounts or other names. Ownership of a deposit account does not represent an interest in the capital of the credit union upon dissolution or conversion to another type of institution. A deposit account is a debt owed by the credit union to the account holder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Federal power&rdquo; means any activity, right, privilege, or immunity granted to any federal credit union under any federal statute, rule, regulation, interpretation, or court decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Membership share&rdquo; means a balance held by a credit union and established by a member in accordance with standards specified by the credit union. Each member may own only one membership share. Ownership of a membership share confers membership and voting rights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Members of the immediate family&rdquo; shall be defined in the credit union&rsquo;s bylaws and may include persons related by blood or marriage, as well as foster and adopted children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reserves&rdquo; means allocations of retained earnings and includes regular and special reserves, except for any allowances for loan losses and investment losses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Residential real property&rdquo; means real property on which is situated a dwelling unit comprised of not more than four family units, the primary use of which is occupancy as a home, and includes, without limitation, a condominium or cooperative apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Share&rdquo; or &ldquo;share account&rdquo; means a balance held by a credit union and established by a member in accordance with standards specified by the credit union including balances designated as &ldquo;regular shares,&rdquo; &ldquo;share draft accounts,&rdquo; &ldquo;share certificates,&rdquo; &ldquo;membership shares&rdquo; or other names. Ownership of a share account represents an interest in the capital of the credit union upon dissolution or conversion to another type of institution. [L 1993, c 350, pt of ยง1]</p>
