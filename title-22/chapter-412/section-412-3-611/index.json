The publication shall state the fact that a merger or consolidation will take place and shall describe the effect, if any, on the operations and employees of the nondepository financial services loan company. Publication shall be made once in a newspaper of general circulation. [L 1993, c 350, pt of §1; am L 2006, c 228, §29] "
