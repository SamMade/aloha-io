<p>(b) A savings and loan association may invest its own assets in bonds, securities, or similar obligations issued by this State or any county of this State, through an appropriate agency or instrumentality.</p>

<p>&copy; To the extent specified herein, a savings and loan association may invest its own assets in bonds or similar obligations issued by any state of the United States other than this State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States, by municipal governments of such states, territories or possessions or by any foreign country or political subdivision of such country; provided, that:</p>

<p>(1) The bond, note, or warrant has been issued in compliance with the constitution and laws of any such government;</p>

<p>(2) Personal property used in or necessary to the accommodation of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s business, including but not limited to furniture, fixtures, equipment, vaults and safety deposit boxes. The savings and loan association&rsquo;s investment in furniture and fixtures shall not, without the approval of the commissioner, exceed twenty-five per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus;</p>

<p>(5) The seller&rsquo;s interest under an agreement of sale, as that term is defined in sections 501-101.5 and 502-85, including without limitation the reversionary interest in the real estate and the right to income under the agreement of sale, with or without recourse to the seller.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise authorized in this section any real property acquired by a savings and loan association pursuant to subsection (f)(4) shall be sold or exchanged for other real property by the savings and loan association within five years after title thereto has vested in it by purchase or otherwise, or within such further time as may be granted by the commissioner.</p>

<p>Any savings and loan association acquiring any real property in any manner other than provided by this section shall immediately, upon receiving notice from the commissioner, charge the same to profit and loss, or otherwise remove the same from assets, and when any loss impairs the capital and surplus of the savings and loan association the impairment shall be made good in the manner provided in this chapter.</p>

<p>(g) A savings and loan association may own or control the capital stock:</p>

<p>(1) Of operating subsidiaries as set forth in this article;</p>

<p>(2) Of a corporation organized and existing for the ownership of real or personal property used or which the savings and loan association in good faith expects to be used in the savings and loan association&rsquo;s business;</p>

<p>(3) Of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Student Loan Marketing Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or of any other corporation organized for substantially the same purposes; provided that this subsection shall be deemed to authorize subscription for as well as purchase of the stock;</p>

<p>(4) Of small business investment companies operating under the Federal Small Business Investment Act of 1958;</p>

<p>(5) Of service corporations as set forth in this article;</p>

<p>(6) Of a corporation whose stock is acquired or purchased to save a loss on a preexisting debt secured by such stock; provided, that the stock shall be sold within twelve months of the date acquired or purchased, or within such further time as may be granted by the commissioner; and</p>

<p>(7) Of a captive insurance or association captive insurance company incorporated under the laws of the United States, or any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>(h) To the extent specified herein, a savings and loan association may invest its own assets in limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, limited liability companies, or corporations formed to invest in residential properties that will qualify for the low income housing tax credit under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and under chapters 235 and 241; provided that the total amount invested by a savings and loan association under this subsection in any one limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or corporation shall not, without the prior approval of the commissioner, exceed two per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus and the aggregate amount invested under this subsection shall not, without the prior approval of the commissioner, exceed five per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus. In no case shall the aggregate amount invested by a savings and loan association under this subsection exceed ten per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus.
