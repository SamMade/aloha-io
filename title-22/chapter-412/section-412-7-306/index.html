<p>(1) Securities and obligations of the United States government and any agency of the United States government whose debt obligations are fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the United States, including without limitation Federal Reserve Banks, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Veterans Administration, the Federal Housing Administration, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Commodity Credit Corporation, and the Small Business Administration;</p>

<p>(2) Bonds, notes, mortgage backed securities, and other debt obligations of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Banks;</p>

<p>(3) Securities and obligations of United States government-sponsored agencies which are originally established or chartered by the United States government to serve public purposes specified by the Congress but whose debt obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States, including without limitation Banks for Cooperatives, Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, Federal Land Banks, Financing Corporation, Resolution Funding Corporation, Student Loan Marketing Association, Tennessee Valley Authority, the United States Postal Service, and securities and obligations of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Banks that are not bonds, notes, mortgage backed securities, or other debt obligations of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Banks; provided that the total amount invested in obligations of any one issuer shall not exceed twenty per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus; and</p>

<p>(4) Securities and obligations of quasi-United States governmental institutions, including without limitation the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, and other multilateral lending institutions or regional development institutions in which the United States government is a shareholder or contributing member; provided that the total amount invested in obligations of any one issuer shall not exceed twenty per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus.</p>

<p>(b) A savings and loan association may invest its own assets in bonds, securities, or similar obligations issued by this State or any county of this State, through an appropriate agency or instrumentality.</p>

<p>&copy; To the extent specified herein, a savings and loan association may invest its own assets in bonds or similar obligations issued by any state of the United States other than this State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States, by municipal governments of such states, territories or possessions or by any foreign country or political subdivision of such country; provided, that:</p>

<p>(1) The bond, note, or warrant has been issued in compliance with the constitution and laws of any such government;</p>

<p>(2) There has been no default in payment of either principal or interest on any of the general obligations of such government for a period of five years immediately preceding the date of the investment; and</p>

Investment grade does not include investments which are predominantly speculative in nature. The aggregate amount invested by a savings and loan association under this subsection and subsection (d) in any one company or other issuer shall not exceed twenty per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus.</p>

<p>(2) Personal property used in or necessary to the accommodation of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s business, including but not limited to furniture, fixtures, equipment, vaults and safety deposit boxes. The savings and loan association&rsquo;s investment in furniture and fixtures shall not, without the approval of the commissioner, exceed twenty-five per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus;</p>

<p>(3) Personal and real property which the savings and loan association acquires for the purpose of leasing to its subsidiaries and affiliates;</p>

<p>(4) Such real property or tangible personal property as may come into its possession as security for loans or in the collection of debts, or as may be purchased by or conveyed to the savings and loan association in satisfaction of or on account of debts previously contracted in the course of its business when such property was held as security by the savings and loan association; and</p>

<p>(5) The seller&rsquo;s interest under an agreement of sale, as that term is defined in sections 501-101.5 and 502-85, including without limitation the reversionary interest in the real estate and the right to income under the agreement of sale, with or without recourse to the seller.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise authorized in this section any real property acquired by a savings and loan association pursuant to subsection (f)(4) shall be sold or exchanged for other real property by the savings and loan association within five years after title thereto has vested in it by purchase or otherwise, or within such further time as may be granted by the commissioner.</p>

<p>Any savings and loan association acquiring any real property in any manner other than provided by this section shall immediately, upon receiving notice from the commissioner, charge the same to profit and loss, or otherwise remove the same from assets, and when any loss impairs the capital and surplus of the savings and loan association the impairment shall be made good in the manner provided in this chapter.</p>

<p>(g) A savings and loan association may own or control the capital stock:</p>

<p>(1) Of operating subsidiaries as set forth in this article;</p>

<p>(2) Of a corporation organized and existing for the ownership of real or personal property used or which the savings and loan association in good faith expects to be used in the savings and loan association&rsquo;s business;</p>

<p>(3) Of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Student Loan Marketing Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or of any other corporation organized for substantially the same purposes; provided that this subsection shall be deemed to authorize subscription for as well as purchase of the stock;</p>

<p>(4) Of small business investment companies operating under the Federal Small Business Investment Act of 1958;</p>

<p>(5) Of service corporations as set forth in this article;</p>

<p>(6) Of a corporation whose stock is acquired or purchased to save a loss on a preexisting debt secured by such stock; provided, that the stock shall be sold within twelve months of the date acquired or purchased, or within such further time as may be granted by the commissioner; and</p>

<p>(7) Of a captive insurance or association captive insurance company incorporated under the laws of the United States, or any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>(h) To the extent specified herein, a savings and loan association may invest its own assets in limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, limited liability companies, or corporations formed to invest in residential properties that will qualify for the low income housing tax credit under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and under chapters 235 and 241; provided that the total amount invested by a savings and loan association under this subsection in any one limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or corporation shall not, without the prior approval of the commissioner, exceed two per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus and the aggregate amount invested under this subsection shall not, without the prior approval of the commissioner, exceed five per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus. In no case shall the aggregate amount invested by a savings and loan association under this subsection exceed ten per cent of the savings and loan association&rsquo;s capital and surplus.
