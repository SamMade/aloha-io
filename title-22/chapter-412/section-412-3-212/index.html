      <p><strong>§412:3-212 Final application for charter or license.</strong> (a) After completing its organization of the Hawaii financial institution, the applicant in organization may file with the commissioner an application for a charter or license to engage in the business of a Hawaii financial institution. The application shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner and, unless waived by the commissioner, shall contain the following information:</p>

<p>(1) A sworn statement by the applicant in organization that it has complied with all requirements of law concerning the organization of the proposed financial institution, including but not limited to the requirement that the full amount of its required capital and surplus has been paid in or deposited in escrow under terms satisfactory to the commissioner;</p>

<p>(2) The names and addresses of all common and preferred shareholders, and elected or appointed directors and executive officers of the proposed financial institution and any holding company of the financial institution, and the number of shares owned by each;</p>

<p>(3) A description of any material changes that have occurred in the financial institution&rsquo;s organizers or the applicant in organization, its business plan, and its financial condition since the issuance of the preliminary approval to organize, accompanied by updated financial statements of the financial institution, any holding company of the financial institution, the applicant in organization, and all executive officers and directors of the financial institution and any holding company of the financial institution;</p>

<p>(4) Evidence that all federal deposit insurance, fidelity bonds, and any other insurance, as represented in the application for preliminary approval to organize, have been or will be obtained and in effect prior to opening;</p>

<p>(5) A description of the financial institution&rsquo;s disaster recovery policies and programs, security programs, and all vending contractors for electronic data processing and servicing that are or will be in effect prior to opening; and</p>

<p>(6) Any other information that the commissioner may require.</p>

<p>(b) The commissioner shall review the application, may conduct an examination of the financial institution, and may interview any proposed director or executive officer.</p>

<p>&copy; If the commissioner is satisfied that the financial institution and, if applicable, its holding company have fulfilled all the requirements of law and the grounds for preliminary approval, and that the financial institution is qualified to engage in the business of a financial institution, the commissioner shall issue a written decision and order approving the application. The order may restrict the payment of dividends for a period of up to three years, and may contain any other conditions and restrictions on the financial institution that are in the public interest, including but not limited to the divestment of any contractual arrangement with an affiliate or subsidiary involving any type of business not permitted under this chapter. Upon the satisfactory fulfillment by the financial institution and, if applicable, its holding company of the conditions in the written decision and order approving the application, the commissioner shall issue to the financial institution a charter or license to engage in the business of a financial institution under this chapter.
