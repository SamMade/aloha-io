      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Submissions to commissioner</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง412:3-112 Submissions to commissioner.</strong> (a) Every Hawaii financial institution, at its own expense, shall file the following written reports with the commissioner:</p>

<p>(1) An independent audit report of its financial statements as of the close of its fiscal year shall be filed by a Hawaii financial institution, other than a nondepository financial services loan company or credit union, within one hundred twenty days of the close of its fiscal year; provided that the commissioner for good cause shown may grant a reasonable extension of not more than forty-five days. For depository institutions, the independent audit report specified in this paragraph shall comply with the requirements for annual reports under section 36 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. ยง1831m), as amended; provided that for a depository institution which, in any fiscal year, is a small depository institution within the meaning of section 36(j) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or any implementing regulations thereunder, the independent audit report specified in this paragraph shall comply with the requirements for annual independent audits of financial statements under section 36(d). For trust companies, the independent audit report shall contain audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be based on an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the independent auditor&rsquo;s report on the fair presentation of the financial statements and any qualification to the report, any management letter, and any other report. Hawaii financial institutions that are subsidiaries of a financial institution holding company may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by filing an independent audit report of the financial institution holding company;</p>

<p>(2) Unaudited financial statements as of the following dates shall be filed by a Hawaii financial institution within thirty days of the date of the financial statement as follows:</p>

<p>(A) For a trust company or credit union, the statements shall be filed as of June 30 and December 31 of each year;</p>

<p>(B) For a Hawaii financial institution, other than a nondepository financial services loan company, trust company, or credit union, the statements shall be filed as of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year; and</p>

<p>&copy; For a nondepository financial services loan company, the statement shall be filed as of the last day of the sixth month and the last day of the twelfth month of each fiscal or calendar year;</p>

<p>provided that the commissioner for good cause shown may grant a reasonable extension of not more than forty-five days.</p>

<p>The reports shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner and prepared in accordance with section 412:3-108. In the alternative, the institution may file the Call Reports, Consolidated Reports of Condition and Reports of Income, or Thrift Financial Reports as of those dates which are submitted to the appropriate federal regulatory agency of the institution;</p>

<p>(3) A notice of any change in the office of the person who has primary responsibility for the operation and management of the financial institution shall be filed by a Hawaii financial institution within ten days of the change. The notice shall specify the name and address of the person, who shall be designated that institution&rsquo;s &ldquo;chief executive officer&rdquo;; and</p>

<p>(4) Any other reports and other information that the commissioner may require with respect to any financial institution at the times and in the form as the commissioner deems appropriate for the proper supervision and regulation of the institution.</p>

<p>Each report shall be signed by an officer authorized by the institution&rsquo;s board of directors to sign the report, and shall contain a declaration of the officer&rsquo;s authority and a statement that the report is true and correct.</p>

<p>(b) Each wholly-owned subsidiary of a Hawaii financial institution whose assets constitute ten per cent or more of the consolidated assets of the Hawaii financial institution shall also submit separate unaudited financial statements meeting the requirements of subsections (a)(2)(A) or (B) as applicable, whether or not the financial institution prepares a consolidated financial statement.</p>

<p>&copy; If the commissioner determines that any report is inadequate, the report shall be returned to the financial institution, with directions to rectify the inadequacies within the time specified by the commissioner, which shall not be longer than thirty days; provided that the commissioner may, for good cause shown, grant a reasonable extension of not more than forty-five days for making and filing such report.</p>

<p>(d) The commissioner may impose an administrative fine upon any financial institution failing to furnish any report or information as required under this section. The fine shall not exceed $1,000 for each day that the report is delinquent and shall be recovered pursuant to the provisions of section 412:2-609.
