<p>The exercise of authority conferred in this subsection shall be governed by and comply with chapter 485A and any securities rules adopted under chapter 485A or the laws and administrative rules of the state, dependency, insular possession, or foreign country applicable to the conduct of such securities activities within that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>&copy; The bank shall file an application for approval with the commissioner in a form prescribed by the commissioner and accompanied by a fee assessed pursuant to section 412:2-105.2. The application shall contain:</p>

<p>(1) A description of the activities to be conducted;</p>

<p>(2) The experience and qualifications of the proposed managers;</p>

<p>(3) The specific location where the activities will be conducted; and</p>

Upon being satisfied that the application is complete, that the conduct of the securities activities will not affect the safety or soundness of the bank or harm the public interest, and that the bank and its subsidiary or affiliate, if applicable, have sufficient experience, qualifications, and financial capability to engage in the activities authorized by this section, the commissioner shall approve the application. The commissioner may impose any terms and conditions that the commissioner considers necessary to protect the bank, the customers of the bank, and the public interest.</p>

<p>(e) The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this chapter. The powers granted by this section may be exercised notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter. Furthermore, the commissioner may adopt rules governing the exercise of powers granted by this section as the commissioner finds necessary to avoid unsound banking practices, to ensure the safety and soundness of the bank, and to protect the public interest.
