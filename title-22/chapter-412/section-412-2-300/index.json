In enforcing the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner is authorized to use the powers in this part without limitation to direct the discontinuance of any violation of law, or any unsafe or unsound practice that is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the institution. The provisions of this chapter may be enforced by informal or formal actions. Informal actions include board resolutions, letter agreements, records of action, memoranda of understanding, or supervisory agreements. Formal actions include cease and desist orders (whether temporary or permanent), removal orders, suspension and revocation orders, divestiture orders, and orders enforcing statutory provisions.
