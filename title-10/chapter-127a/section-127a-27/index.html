      <p><strong>[ยง127A-27] Preliminary or interlocutory injunctions and temporary restraining orders.</strong> Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no preliminary or interlocutory injunction, or temporary restraining order, suspending, enjoining, or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of, or setting aside, in whole or in part, on the ground of unconstitutionality or for any other reason or reasons, any provision of this chapter or any proclamation, order, or rule prescribed, made, or issued under the authority of this chapter, shall be issued or granted by any court of the State, or by any judge thereof, unless the application for the same is presented to a circuit judge, is heard and determined by the circuit judge sitting with two other circuit judges, and a majority of the judges concur in granting the application. When the application is presented to a judge, the judge shall immediately notify the chief justice of the supreme court of the State, or the senior associate justice in the event of the chief justice&rsquo;s absence or incapacity or a vacancy in the office, who shall forthwith assign two other circuit judges to sit with the circuit judge in hearing and determining the application.</p>

<p>The application shall not be heard or determined before at least five days&rsquo; notice of the hearing has been given to the governor and the attorney general, or to the mayor and the county corporation counsel, as applicable, and to such other persons as may be defendants or respondents in the suits. In cases in which immediate irreparable damage would otherwise ensue to the petitioner, the circuit judge to whom the application is made may, after giving notice to the governor and the attorney general, or the mayor and the county corporation counsel, as applicable, and allowing them an opportunity to appear, grant a temporary stay or suspension, in whole or in part, of the operation of the statutory provision, proclamation, order, or rule. The temporary stay or suspension shall remain in force only until the hearing and determination of the application for a preliminary or interlocutory injunction, and in any event for not more than ten days from the date of the order of the judge. If the two additional circuit judges have been assigned to the case, no temporary stay or suspension shall be ordered unless a majority of the three circuit judges shall concur.</p>

<p>In a case of the stay or suspension, the order of the judge or judges shall contain a finding or findings, based upon evidence submitted to the judge or judges and incorporated in the order by reference thereto, that irreparable damage would result to the petitioner, and specifying the nature of the damage and why it is immediate and irreparable. The three circuit judges assigned to sit in the case may, upon a like finding and for good cause shown, appearing from reasons entered of record, continue the temporary stay or suspension for an additional ten-day period, but for only one such period unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The hearing upon an application for a preliminary or interlocutory injunction shall be given precedence and shall be in every way expedited and be assigned for hearing at the earliest practicable day.</p>

<p>If a temporary stay or suspension has been allowed, the application for a preliminary or interlocutory injunction shall be set for hearing within five days after the granting of the stay or suspension. When the matter comes on for hearing, the party who obtained the temporary stay or suspension shall proceed with the application for a preliminary or interlocutory injunction. Otherwise the temporary order shall be dissolved forthwith. No extension of time shall be granted without the approval of at least two of the three judges. Upon the final hearing of any such suit, the same requirement as to judges and the same procedure as to expedition shall apply. [L 2014, c 111, pt of ยง2]</p>
