      <p><strong>[ยง121-43] Nonforfeiture for absence.</strong> (a) Every employee of a private employer who is a member of the national guard shall be entitled to absent oneself from the employee&rsquo;s employment duties while engaged in the performance of ordered national guard service and while going to and returning from such service. Such person shall:</p>

<p>(1) If still qualified to perform the person&rsquo;s employment duties, be restored by such employer or the employer&rsquo;s successor in interest to such position or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay; or</p>

<p>(2) If not qualified to perform the person&rsquo;s employment duties, by reason of disability sustained during ordered national guard service, but qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of such employer or the employer&rsquo;s successor in interest, be offered employment and, if such person so requests, be employed by such employer or the employer&rsquo;s successor in interest in such other position the duties of which such person is qualified to perform as will provide such person like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances in such person&rsquo;s case,</p>

<p>unless the employer&rsquo;s circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable to do so.</p>

<p>(b) (1) Any person who is restored to or employed in a position in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence; shall be so restored or reemployed without loss of seniority; shall be entitled to participate in insurance or other benefits offered by the employer pursuant to established rules and practices relating to employees on furlough or leave of absence in effect with the employer at the time such person was ordered to national guard service; and shall not be discharged from such employment position without cause within one year after such restoration or reemployment.</p>

<p>(2) Any person who is restored to or employed in a position in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) should be so restored or reemployed in such manner as to give such person such status in the person&rsquo;s employment as the person would have enjoyed if such person had continued in such employment continuously from the time such person became engaged in the performance of ordered national guard service until the time of such person&rsquo;s restoration to such employment, or reemployment.</p>

<p>(3) Any person who holds a position described in subsection (a) shall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of the national guard. [L 1979, c 5, ยง1; gen ch 1985]</p>
