(b) Each shell, mine, comet, and multiple tube device, such as finale or barrage boxes, roman candle batteries, or cakes, shall bear a permanent label listing the licensee&amp;rsquo;s name, address, and contact information to include telephone number or electronic mail address. The label shall also list the name and business address of the manufacturer. The label shall be approved by the state fire council and conform to the following standards: (1) Numerals and letters of the printed matter shall be not less than one-eighth of an inch high; (2) Required statements shall be printed in a color that contrasts sharply with the background and shall be printed within a borderline; and (3) The label shall measure at least nine inches by nine inches; provided that if the size of the shell, mine, comet, or multiple tube device is too small to correctly display a label of this size, the label may be reduced to a size no smaller than necessary to properly display the information described in this section.
