  "context": "[ยง124A-83] Effective date of sentences. (a) Whenever a sentence of a court-martial as lawfully adjudged and approved includes a forfeiture of pay or allowances in addition to confinement not suspended, the forfeiture may apply to pay or allowances becoming due on or after the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority. No forfeiture may extend to any pay or allowances accrued before that date. (b) Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement. Rules adopted by the governor may provide that sentences of confinement may not be executed until approved by designated officers. &amp;copy; All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date ordered executed.
