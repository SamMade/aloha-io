[(a)] The operation, navigation, use, or maintenance by any person, whether a resident or nonresident of the State, of any boat, ship, barge, or other watercraft in the navigable waters of the State shall subject the person to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State in any action or proceeding against the person growing out of any accident, collision, or claim for damages in which the person and the boat, ship, barge, or other watercraft may be involved in the navigable waters. The operation, navigation, use, or maintenance is deemed a signification of the person&amp;rsquo;s agreement that any summons against the person which is served is of the same legal force and validity as if served upon the person personally within this State, whether the person is a nonresident of this State or at the time a cause of action arises is a resident of this State but subsequently becomes a nonresident of this State. Service of the summons is to be made as provided by section 634-36, if the defendant cannot be found in the State. [(b)] This section shall not be construed as repealing or amending any other provision of law relating to the service of process nor as establishing an exclusive method of service of process in cases to which this section may apply.
