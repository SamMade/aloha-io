      <p><strong>[§634-21.5] Service of process within a condominium, cooperative housing, or planned community.</strong> (a) Each board of directors of an association of apartment owners governed by chapter 514A or 514B, cooperative housing corporation governed by chapter 421I, and planned community association governed by chapter 421J shall establish, if entry to the property is inaccessible to the general public, a policy to provide reasonable access as specified in subsection (b) to the building or community to persons authorized to serve civil process for the purpose of serving any summons, subpoena, notice, or order on a person who is identified by the document being served as residing or present in the condominium, cooperative housing project, or planned community.</p>

<p>(b) The policy established pursuant to subsection (a) shall:</p>

<p>(1) Subject to any conditions as may be specified in accordance with paragraph (4), allow a person authorized to serve civil process to access common areas adjacent to a principal entry to the residence specified in accordance with paragraph (2) for the sole purpose of attempting to effect service of process;</p>

<p>(2) Require that a person authorized to serve civil process present clear personal identification and evidence that the person is authorized to serve process, including documentation clearly indicating the precise name and address, and if applicable, a unit number, of the person residing or present on the property to be served;</p>

<p>(3) Allow for denial of access to the person authorized to serve civil process if the person is unable to produce clear and credible identification and documentation as required in paragraph (2);</p>
