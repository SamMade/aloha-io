Case Notes Defendant removed action to U.S. district court alleging complete diversity of citizenship based on plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s notice of defendant doctor&amp;rsquo;s death, and argued, inter alia, that under Hawaii law, a decedent is not a proper party to an action; because the time in which to substitute doctor&amp;rsquo;s estate or representative had not yet passed, the action against doctor had not been dismissed; therefore, removal on that basis was premature. 61 F. Supp. 2d 1121 (1999). Trespass quare clausum abates upon death of plaintiff. 6 H. 556 (1885), questioned 45 H. 373, 375, 369 P.2d 96 (1961).
