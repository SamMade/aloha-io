Rev. 411 (2001). Case Notes Given the allegations in plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s complaint, the filing of the office of disciplinary counsel (ODC) complaint by defendant against plaintiff did not constitute &amp;ldquo;public participation&amp;rdquo; before a governmental body, as defined in §634F-1, because the ODC complaint did not involve &amp;ldquo;oral or written testimony&amp;rdquo; but rather set forth allegations and was a request to the ODC for an investigation. Based on the plain meaning of &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo;, even when liberally construed, the ODC complaint and allegations contained therein were not &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo; and were not protected under this chapter; legislative history of chapter discussed. 129 H. 95 (App.), 294 P.3d 1081 (2013). With respect to plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claims based on defendant siblings&amp;rsquo; communications with the mayor, the mayor&amp;rsquo;s assistant, and members of the county council, the communications did not constitute &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo; submitted or provided &amp;ldquo;during the course of a governmental proceeding&amp;rdquo; and did not constitute a strategic lawsuit against public participation. Even under a liberal construction of §634F-1, nothing in this chapter suggests that an individual&amp;rsquo;s unsolicited and informal communication with a government official, when there is no formal process or procedure in progress, constitutes &amp;ldquo;testimony submitted or provided to a governmental body during the course of a governmental proceeding&amp;rdquo;; legislative history of chapter discussed. 129 H. 95 (App.), 294 P.3d 1081 (2013).
