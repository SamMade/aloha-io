  "context": "[ยง634F-1] Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: &amp;ldquo;Governmental body&amp;rdquo; includes a branch, department, agency, instrumentality, official, employee, agent, or other person acting under color of law of the United States, a state, or subdivision of a state or other public authority. &amp;ldquo;Judicial claim&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;claim&amp;rdquo; includes any lawsuit, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or other judicial pleading or filing requesting relief. &amp;ldquo;Lacks substantial justification&amp;rdquo; means substantially frivolous, substantially groundless, or substantially vexatious. &amp;ldquo;Motion&amp;rdquo; includes any motion to dismiss, for summary judgment, for judgment on the pleadings or to strike, a demurrer, or any other judicial pleading filed to dispose of a judicial claim. &amp;ldquo;Moving party&amp;rdquo; means any person on whose behalf the motion described in section 634F-2 is filed seeking dismissal of the judicial claim. &amp;ldquo;Person&amp;rdquo; includes any individual, corporation, association, organization, partnership, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, or other legal entity. &amp;ldquo;Public participation&amp;rdquo; means any oral or written testimony submitted or provided to a governmental body during the course of a governmental proceeding. &amp;ldquo;Responding party&amp;rdquo; means any person against whom the motion described in section 634F-2 is filed. &amp;ldquo;SLAPP&amp;rdquo; means a strategic lawsuit against public participation and refers to a lawsuit that lacks substantial justification or is interposed for delay or harassment and that is solely based on the party&amp;rsquo;s public participation before a governmental body. [L 2002, c 187, pt of ยง2] Case Notes Given the allegations in plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s complaint, the filing of the office of disciplinary counsel (ODC) complaint by defendant against plaintiff did not constitute &amp;ldquo;public participation&amp;rdquo; before a governmental body, as defined in this section, because the ODC complaint did not involve &amp;ldquo;oral or written testimony&amp;rdquo; but rather set forth allegations and was a request to the ODC for an investigation. Based on the plain meaning of &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo;, even when liberally construed, the ODC complaint and allegations contained therein were not &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo; and were not protected under chapter 634F. 129 H. 95 (App.), 294 P.3d 1081 (2013). With respect to plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claims based on defendant siblings&amp;rsquo; communications with the mayor, the mayor&amp;rsquo;s assistant, and members of the county council, the communications did not constitute &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo; submitted or provided &amp;ldquo;during the course of a governmental proceeding&amp;rdquo; and did not constitute a strategic lawsuit against public participation. Even under a liberal construction of this section, nothing in chapter 634F suggests that an individual&amp;rsquo;s unsolicited and informal communication with a government official, when there is no formal process or procedure in progress, constitutes &amp;ldquo;testimony submitted or provided to a governmental body during the course of a governmental proceeding&amp;rdquo;. 129 H. 95 (App.), 294 P.3d 1081 (2013).
