Whenever in any action brought on a prior judgment, the complaint fails to credit prior payments on the judgment, the defendant shall be entitled to offset against the true balance due on the judgment an amount double the amount of any such credit in addition to any other penalties by law prescribed in such circumstances unless the plaintiff shall show that the existence or amount of the credit was in bona fide dispute or that the failure to set forth the credit was inadvertent or the result of an honest mistake.
