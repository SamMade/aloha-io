      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Use of public buildings by blind or visually handicapped persons</h2>
      <p><strong>§102-14 Use of public buildings by blind or visually handicapped persons.</strong> (a) For the purpose of providing blind or visually handicapped persons, as defined in sections 235-1, 347-1, and 347-2 with remunerative employment, enlarging their economic opportunities and stimulating them to greater efforts in striving to make themselves self-supporting, blind or visually handicapped persons registered by the department of human services under section 347-6 and issued permits under subsection &copy; shall be authorized to operate vending facilities and machines in any state or county public building for the vending of newspapers, periodicals, confections, tobacco products, foods, beverages, and such other articles or services prepared on or off the premises in accordance with all applicable laws.</p>

<p>(b) The department of human services, after consultation with authorities responsible for management of state or county public buildings, shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 91, necessary for the implementation of this section, including, but not limited to rules to assure that priority be given to registered blind or visually handicapped persons in the operation of vending facilities in state or county public buildings and to establish, whenever feasible, one or more vending facilities in all state and county public buildings.</p>

<p>&copy; Assignment of vending facilities and space for vending machines shall be by permit issued by the department of human services.</p>

<p>(d) No person shall advertise or otherwise solicit the sale of food or beverages for human consumption in any public building which is in competition with a vending facility or machine operated or maintained by a duly authorized blind or visually handicapped person as prescribed by rules and regulations established under chapter 91. Any person who violates this subsection shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000.</p>

<p>(e) After July 1, 1981, or upon the expiration of vending machine contracts in existence on June 10, 1981, no vending machines shall be placed in any state or county public building in which there is a vending facility or machine assigned by permit to a blind or visually handicapped person except pursuant to a permit issued by the department of human services.</p>

<p>(f) Any permit granted pursuant hereto may be terminated by the department of human services if the department determines that the vending facility or machine is not being operated in accordance with prescribed rules.</p>

<p>(g) This section shall not apply to the judiciary history center facilities in the Ali<code>iolani Hale building, University of Hawai</code>i system, public library system facilities, department of education facilities, department of transportation airport and harbor restaurant and lounge facilities and operations, public parks, and state and county facilities designed and intended for use as facilities for entertainment and other public events.</p>

<p>(h) After July 1, 1981, any department, agency, or instrumentality of the State or any of its political subdivisions planning the construction, substantial alteration, or renovations of any building shall consider including plans for a vending facility maintained or operated by a blind or visually handicapped person. The present vendor who is operating a vending facility shall not be displaced or dislocated from any state or county building because of renovations or substantial alterations, except for any temporary displacement or dislocation which may be necessary for the completion of the renovations or alterations. Any such vendor shall have the first option to operate the facility upon completion of the renovations or substantial alterations. [L 1937, c 208, §1; RL 1945, §465; RL 1955, §7-20; am L 1959, c 246, §14; am L 1964, c 30, §2; <a href="/title-9/chapter-102/section-102-14/">HRS §102-14</a>; am L 1981, c 131, §1; am L 1987, c 339, §4; am L 1993, c 328, §2; am L 1994, c 57, §3; am L 1996, c 138, §2]</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>As the federal adjudication path applied to disputes arising from the Hawaii Randolph-Sheppard Act, trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the merits of the case. 112 H. 388, 146 P.3d 103.</p>
