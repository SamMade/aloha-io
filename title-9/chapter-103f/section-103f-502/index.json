(d) A decision under subsection &amp;copy; shall be final and conclusive. [L 1997, c 190, pt of §2] Case Notes As nothing in this chapter expressly precluded judicial review, it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; judicial review was available in connection with chapter 103F by way of a declaratory action under §632-1. 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012). Under the circumstances of the case, the decisions of the administrative officers of the department of education to reject the proposal of petitioner that responded to a request for proposals to provide health and human services under contracts pursuant to this chapter were subject to judicial review; §§103F-501 and 103F-504 and subsection &amp;copy; do not prohibit judicial review. 127 H. 263, 277 P.3d 988 (2012).
