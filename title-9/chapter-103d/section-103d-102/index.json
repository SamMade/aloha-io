Attorney General Opinions The Code did not apply to board of trustees of deferred compensation plan&amp;rsquo;s existing administrator or investment-product-provider contracts because they were entered into prior to July 1, 1994 applicability date in subsection (a) (Comp. 1993). Att. Gen. Op. 94-4. The State&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of gifts is not subject to the procurement code; the procurement code applies to only contracts for the purchase of goods, services, or construction. Att. Gen. Op. 16-2. Case Notes Subsection (b) precludes administrative review of a chief procurement officer&amp;rsquo;s exemption determination; hearings officer correctly concluded that officer did not have jurisdiction to review chief procurement officer&amp;rsquo;s determination that the interim library automation services contract at issue was exempt from the requirements of the procurement code. 93 H. 155, 997 P.2d 567. Subsection (b)(4)(L) could not serve as a basis on which to justify the procurement policy board&amp;rsquo;s promulgation of §3-122-66 (repealed), Hawaii administrative rules, which was outside the scope of the board&amp;rsquo;s authority; among other things, the factual situation of less than three qualified persons under §3-122-66 could not be rationalized as an unenumerated exception within the scope of subsection (b)(4). 132 H. 333, 322 P.3d 228 (2014).
