<p>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p>The Code did not apply to board of trustees of deferred compensation plan&rsquo;s existing administrator or investment-product-provider contracts because they were entered into prior to July 1, 1994 applicability date in subsection (a) (Comp. 1993). Att. Gen. Op. 94-4.</p>

<p>The State&rsquo;s acceptance of gifts is not subject to the procurement code; the procurement code applies to only contracts for the purchase of goods, services, or construction. Att. Gen. Op. 16-2.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Subsection (b) precludes administrative review of a chief procurement officer&rsquo;s exemption determination; hearings officer correctly concluded that officer did not have jurisdiction to review chief procurement officer&rsquo;s determination that the interim library automation services contract at issue was exempt from the requirements of the procurement code. 93 H. 155, 997 P.2d 567.</p>

<p>Subsection (b)(4)(L) could not serve as a basis on which to justify the procurement policy board&rsquo;s promulgation of §3-122-66 (repealed), Hawaii administrative rules, which was outside the scope of the board&rsquo;s authority; among other things, the factual situation of less than three qualified persons under §3-122-66 could not be rationalized as an unenumerated exception within the scope of subsection (b)(4). 132 H. 333, 322 P.3d 228 (2014).</p>
