(a) Unless the policy board determines otherwise by rules, bid security shall be required only for construction contracts to be awarded pursuant to sections 103D-302 and 103D-303 and when the price of the contract is estimated by the procurement officer to exceed $25,000 or, if the contract is for goods or services, the purchasing agency secures the approval of the chief procurement officer. Bid security shall be a bond provided by a surety company authorized to do business in the State, or the equivalent in cash, or otherwise supplied in a form specified in rules. (b) Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least five per cent of the amount of the bid. &amp;copy; Unless, pursuant to rules, it is determined that a failure to provide bid security is nonsubstantial, all bids required to be accompanied by bid security shall be rejected when not accompanied by the required bid security. (d) After the bids are opened, they shall be irrevocable for the period specified in the invitation for bids, except as provided in section 103D-302(g). If a bidder is permitted to withdraw its bid before award, no action shall be had against the bidder or the bid security. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of ยง2; am L 1994, c 186, ยง11; am L 1997, c 352, ยง23] "
