[L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of §2; am L 1994, c 186, §7; am L 1996, c 71, §1; am L 1997, c 352, §23; am L 2003, c 51, §1; am L 2011, c 211, §2] Note Definition of &amp;ldquo;state resident&amp;rdquo; for purposes of federal construction employment preferences. L 2000, c 286, §§1, 2. Case Notes Bidder&amp;rsquo;s submission of two bids in a sealed competitive bidding process that permitted submission of only one bid was a material deviation from the bid solicitation special conditions and nonresponsive; bid thus properly rejected. 89 H. 443, 974 P.2d 1033. Where contractor was required to use a licensed plumbing subcontractor for the project and it was undisputed that contractor did not name in its bid a person or firm to be engaged by it as a plumbing subcontractor for the project, contractor&amp;rsquo;s bid was nonresponsive. 101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d 631. Where the record amply indicated that contractor had the capability &amp;ldquo;in all respects to perform fully the contract requirements, and the integrity and reliability which will assure good faith performance&amp;rdquo;, it was therefore a &amp;ldquo;responsible bidder&amp;rdquo; within the meaning of §103D-302(h) and this section. 101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d 631.
