      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Definitions</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง103D-104</strong> <strong>Definitions.</strong> As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Using agency&rdquo; means any governmental body which utilizes any goods, services, or construction procured under this chapter. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of ยง2; am L 1994, c 186, ยง7; am L 1996, c 71, ยง1; am L 1997, c 352, ยง23; am L 2003, c 51, ยง1; am L 2011, c 211, ยง2]</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>Definition of &ldquo;state resident&rdquo; for purposes of federal construction employment preferences. L 2000, c 286, ยงยง1, 2.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Bidder&rsquo;s submission of two bids in a sealed competitive bidding process that permitted submission of only one bid was a material deviation from the bid solicitation special conditions and nonresponsive; bid thus properly rejected. 89 H. 443, 974 P.2d 1033.</p>

<p>Where contractor was required to use a licensed plumbing subcontractor for the project and it was undisputed that contractor did not name in its bid a person or firm to be engaged by it as a plumbing subcontractor for the project, contractor&rsquo;s bid was nonresponsive. 101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d 631.</p>

<p>Where the record amply indicated that contractor had the capability &ldquo;in all respects to perform fully the contract requirements, and the integrity and reliability which will assure good faith performance&rdquo;, it was therefore a &ldquo;responsible bidder&rdquo; within the meaning of ยง103D-302(h) and this section. 101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d 631.</p>
