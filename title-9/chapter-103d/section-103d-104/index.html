      <h1 class="hrsSection-h1">103D-104</h1>
      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Definitions</h2>
      <p><strong>§103D-104</strong> <strong>Definitions.</strong> As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business&rdquo; means any corporation, partnership, individual, sole proprietorship, joint stock company, joint venture, or any other private legal entity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change order&rdquo; means a written order signed by the procurement officer, directing the contractor to make changes which the changes clause of the contract authorizes the procurement officer to order without the consent of the contractor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grant&rdquo; means the furnishing of assistance, whether financial or otherwise, to any person to support a program authorized by law. The term does not include an award whose primary purpose is to procure an end product, whether in the form of goods, services, or construction; a contract resulting from such an award is not a grant but a procurement contract.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Invitation for bids&rdquo; means all documents, whether attached or incorporated by reference, utilized for soliciting bids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Policy board&rdquo; means the procurement policy board created in section 103D-201.</p>

The term also includes all functions that pertain to the obtaining of any good, service, or construction, including description of requirements, selection and solicitation of sources, preparation and award of contracts, and all phases of contract administration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Procurement card&rdquo; means a charge card, with predetermined limitations, used by government agencies in place of cash or purchase orders for the purchase of goods, services, or construction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Responsive bidder&rdquo; means a person who has submitted a bid which conforms in all material respects to the invitation for bids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Services&rdquo; means the furnishing of labor, time, or effort by a contractor, not involving the delivery of a specific end product other than reports which are merely incidental to the required performance.</p>

The term includes descriptions of any requirement for inspecting, testing, or preparing a good, service, or construction item for delivery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Using agency&rdquo; means any governmental body which utilizes any goods, services, or construction procured under this chapter. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of §2; am L 1994, c 186, §7; am L 1996, c 71, §1; am L 1997, c 352, §23; am L 2003, c 51, §1; am L 2011, c 211, §2]</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>Definition of &ldquo;state resident&rdquo; for purposes of federal construction employment preferences. L 2000, c 286, §§1, 2.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Bidder&rsquo;s submission of two bids in a sealed competitive bidding process that permitted submission of only one bid was a material deviation from the bid solicitation special conditions and nonresponsive; bid thus properly rejected. 89 H. 443, 974 P.2d 1033.</p>

<p>Where contractor was required to use a licensed plumbing subcontractor for the project and it was undisputed that contractor did not name in its bid a person or firm to be engaged by it as a plumbing subcontractor for the project, contractor&rsquo;s bid was nonresponsive. 101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d 631.</p>

<p>Where the record amply indicated that contractor had the capability &ldquo;in all respects to perform fully the contract requirements, and the integrity and reliability which will assure good faith performance&rdquo;, it was therefore a &ldquo;responsible bidder&rdquo; within the meaning of §103D-302(h) and this section. 101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d 631.</p>
