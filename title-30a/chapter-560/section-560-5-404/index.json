(a) A copy of the petition and the notice of hearing on a petition for conservatorship or other protective order shall be served personally on the respondent if the respondent has attained fourteen years of age, but if the respondent&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts is unknown or personal service cannot be made, service on the respondent shall be made by certified or registered mail or by publication pursuant to section 560:1-401(a)(3).

(b) In a proceeding to establish a conservatorship or for another protective order, notice of the hearing shall be given to the persons listed in the petition. Failure to give notice under this subsection does not preclude the appointment of a conservator or the making of another protective order. &amp;copy; Notice of the hearing on a petition for an order after appointment of a conservator or making of another protective order, together with a copy of the petition, shall be given to the protected person, if the protected person has attained fourteen years of age and is not missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States, any conservator of the protected person&amp;rsquo;s estate, and any other person as ordered by the court.
