Unless restricted by the court, a supervised personal representative has, without interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives under this chapter, but the personal representative shall not exercise the personal representative&amp;rsquo;s power to make any distribution of the estate without prior order of the court. Any other restriction on the power of a personal representative which may be ordered by the court must be endorsed on the personal representative&amp;rsquo;s letters of appointment and, unless so endorsed, is ineffective as to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative.
