It does not include accounts established for deposit of funds of a partnership, joint venture, or other association for business purposes, or accounts controlled by one or more persons as the duly authorized agent or trustee for a corporation, unincorporated association, charitable or civic organization or a regular fiduciary or trust account where the relationship is established other than by deposit agreement; &amp;ldquo;Net contribution&amp;rdquo; of a party to a joint account as of any given time is the sum of all deposits thereto made by or for the party, less all withdrawals made by or for the party which have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance.

A payable-on-death payee or beneficiary of a trust account is a party only after the account becomes payable to the payable-on-death payee or beneficiary by reason of the payable-on-death payee&amp;rsquo;s or beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s surviving the original payee or trustee. Unless the context otherwise requires, it includes a guardian, conservator, personal representative, or assignee, of a party.

A trust account does not include a regular trust account under a testamentary trust or a trust agreement which has significance apart from the account, or a fiduciary account arising from a fiduciary relation such as attorney-client; &amp;ldquo;Withdrawal&amp;rdquo; includes payment to a third person pursuant to check or other directive of a party.
