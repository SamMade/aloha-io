Prior law. Where definition of &amp;ldquo;incapacitated person&amp;rdquo; in §560:5-101 (2003), when read as a whole, sufficiently apprised ward of the bases on which the court would review the guardianship petition and any ambiguity in the statute did not render it &amp;ldquo;substantially incomprehensible&amp;rdquo;, so as to overcome the &amp;ldquo;presumption of constitutionality&amp;rdquo;, definition was not unconstitutionally vague. 113 H. 236, 151 P.3d 717 (2007).
