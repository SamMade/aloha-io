  "context": "ยง560:5-116 Request for notice; interested persons. An interested person not otherwise entitled to notice who desires to be notified before any order is made in a guardianship proceeding, including a proceeding after the appointment of a guardian, or in a protective proceeding, may file a request for notice with the clerk of the court in which the proceeding is pending. The clerk shall send or deliver a copy of the request to the guardian and to the conservator, if one has been appointed. A request is not effective unless it contains a statement showing the interest of the person making it and the address of that person or a lawyer to whom notice is to be given. The request is effective only as to proceedings conducted after its filing. A governmental agency paying or planning to pay benefits, or providing services, to the respondent or protected person is an interested person in a protective proceeding. [L 2004, c 161, pt of ยง1] "
