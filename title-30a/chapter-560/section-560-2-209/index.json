  "context": "ยง560:2-209 Sources from which elective share payable. (a) In a proceeding for an elective share, the following are applied first to satisfy the elective-share amount and to reduce or eliminate any contributions due from the decedent&amp;rsquo;s probate estate and recipients of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others: (1) Amounts included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-204 which pass or have passed to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary by testate or intestate succession and amounts included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-206; and (2) Amounts included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-207 up to the applicable percentage thereof. For the purposes of this subsection, the &amp;ldquo;applicable percentage&amp;rdquo; is twice the elective-share percentage set forth in the schedule in section 560:2-202(a) appropriate to the length of time: (A) The spouse and the decedent were married to each other; or (B) The reciprocal beneficiary and the decedent were in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship. (b) If, after the application of subsection (a), the elective-share amount is not fully satisfied or the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is entitled to a supplemental elective-share amount, amounts included in the decedent&amp;rsquo;s probate estate and in the decedent&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others, other than amounts included under section 560:2-205(3)(A) or &amp;copy;, are applied first to satisfy the unsatisfied balance of the elective-share amount or the supplemental elective-share amount. The decedent&amp;rsquo;s probate estate and that portion of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others are so applied that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective-share amount or for the supplemental elective-share amount is equitably apportioned among the recipients of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s probate estate and of that portion of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of their interests therein. &amp;copy; If, after the application of subsections (a) and (b), the elective-share or supplemental elective-share amount is not fully satisfied, the remaining portion of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others is so applied that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective-share or supplemental elective-share amount is equitably apportioned among the recipients of the remaining portion of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of their interests therein.
