  "context": "ยง560:5-309 Notice. (a) A copy of a petition for guardianship and notice of the hearing on the petition shall be served personally on the respondent. The notice shall include a statement that the respondent must be physically present unless excused by the court, inform the respondent of the respondent&amp;rsquo;s rights at the hearing, and include a description of the nature, purpose, and consequences of an appointment. A failure to serve the respondent with a notice substantially complying with this subsection shall preclude the court from granting the petition. (b) In a proceeding to establish a guardianship, notice of the hearing shall be given to the persons listed in the petition. For good cause, the court may waive notice to any person listed in the petition other than the respondent, upon a showing that all reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain the identity and address of the person or to effect notice, that the efforts were unsuccessful, and that further efforts should not be required because that person has not demonstrated a reasonable degree of interest in or concern about the respondent. Failure to give notice under this subsection shall not preclude the appointment of a guardian or the making of a protective order. &amp;copy; Notice of the hearing on a petition for an order after appointment of a guardian, together with a copy of the petition, shall be given to the ward, the guardian, and any other person the court directs. (d) A guardian shall give notice of the filing of the guardian&amp;rsquo;s report, together with a copy of the report, to the ward and any other person the court directs. The notice shall be delivered or sent within fourteen days after the filing of the report. [L 2004, c 161, pt of ยง1] "
