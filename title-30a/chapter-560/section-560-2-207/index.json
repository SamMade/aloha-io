Except to the extent included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-204 or 560:2-206, the value of the augmented estate includes the value of: (1) Property that was owned by the decedent&amp;rsquo;s surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary at the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death, including: (A) The surviving spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s fractional interest in property held in joint tenancy with the right of survivorship; (B) The surviving spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s ownership interest in property or accounts held in co-ownership registration with the right of survivorship; and &amp;copy; Property that passed to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary by reason of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death, but not including the spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s right to homestead allowance, family allowance, exempt property, or payments under the federal social security system; and (2) Property that would have been included in the surviving spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others, other than the spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s fractional and ownership interest included under subsection (a)(1)(A) or (B), had the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary been the decedent. (b) Time of valuation. Property included under this section is valued at the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death, taking the fact that the decedent predeceased the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary into account, but, for purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A) and (B), the values of the spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s fractional and ownership interests are determined immediately before the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death if the decedent was then a joint tenant or a co- owner of the property or accounts. For purposes of subsection (a)(2), proceeds of insurance that would have been included in the spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others under section 560:2-205(1)(D) are not valued as if the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary were deceased. &amp;copy; Reduction for enforceable claims. The value of property included under this section is reduced by enforceable claims against the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1; am L 1997, c 383, ยง19] "
