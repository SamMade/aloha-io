(a) The court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment will be in the best interest of the minor. The court shall appoint a person nominated by the minor, if the minor has attained fourteen years of age, unless the court finds the appointment will be contrary to the best interest of the minor. (b) In the interest of developing self-reliance of a ward or for other good cause, the court, at the time of appointment or later, on its own motion or on motion of the minor ward or other interested person, may limit the powers of a guardian otherwise granted by this part and thereby create a limited guardianship, except where a guardian was appointed subsequent to parental rights terminated under chapter 571 or 587A. Following the same procedure, the court may grant additional powers or withdraw powers previously granted. [L 2004, c 161, pt of ยง1; am L 2010, c 135, ยง7] "
