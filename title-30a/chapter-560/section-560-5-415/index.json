  "context": "ยง560:5-415 Bond. The court may require a conservator to furnish a bond conditioned upon faithful discharge of all duties of the conservatorship according to law, with sureties as it may specify. Unless otherwise directed by the court, the cost of the bond shall be charged to the protected person&amp;rsquo;s estate and the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the conservator&amp;rsquo;s control, plus one year&amp;rsquo;s estimated income, and minus the value of assets deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal and the value of any real property that the fiduciary, by express limitation, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. The court, in place of sureties on a bond, may accept collateral for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of real property. [L 2004, c 161, pt of ยง1] "
