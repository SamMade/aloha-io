In the absence of a requirement that a power of appointment be exercised by a reference, or by an express or specific reference, to the power, a general residuary clause in a will, or a will making general disposition of all of the testator&amp;rsquo;s property, expresses an intention to exercise a power of appointment held by the testator only if: (1) The power is a general power and the creating instrument does not contain a gift if the power is not exercised; or (2) The testator&amp;rsquo;s will manifests an intention to include the property subject to the power.
