INTESTATE SUCCESSION Cross References Applies only to the estates of decedents dying after January 1, 1997; for other effect and transition provisions, see §560:8-201. §560:2-101 Intestate estate. (a) Any part of a decedent&amp;rsquo;s estate not effectively disposed of by will passes by intestate succession to the decedent&amp;rsquo;s heirs as prescribed in this chapter, except as modified by the decedent&amp;rsquo;s will. (b) A decedent by will may expressly exclude or limit the right of an individual or class to succeed to property of the decedent passing by intestate succession. If that individual or a member of that class survives the decedent, the share of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s intestate estate to which that individual or class would have succeeded passes as if that individual or each member of that class had disclaimed the intestate share. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1] "
