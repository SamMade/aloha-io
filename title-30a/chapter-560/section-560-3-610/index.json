(a) An appointment of a personal representative terminates as provided in section 560:3-1003, one year after the filing of a closing statement. (b) An order closing an estate as provided in section 560:3-1001 or 560:3-1002 terminates an appointment of a personal representative. &amp;copy; A personal representative may resign the position by filing a written statement of resignation with the registrar after the personal representative has given at least fifteen days written notice to the persons known to be interested in the estate. If no one applies or petitions for appointment of a successor representative within the time indicated in the notice, the filed statement of resignation is ineffective as a termination of appointment and in any event is effective only upon the appointment and qualification of a successor representative and delivery of the assets to that representative.
