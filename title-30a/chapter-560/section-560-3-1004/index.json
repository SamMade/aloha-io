  "context": "ยง560:3-1004 Liability of distributees to claimants. After assets of an estate have been distributed and subject to section 560:3-1006, an undischarged claim not barred may be prosecuted in a proceeding against one or more distributees. No distributee shall be liable to claimants for amounts received as exempt property, homestead or family allowances, or for amounts in excess of the value of that person&amp;rsquo;s distribution as of the time of distribution. As between distributees, each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of administration. Any distributee who shall have failed to notify other distributees of the demand made upon that distributee by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in any proceeding in which the claim was asserted against that distributee loses the right of contribution against other distributees. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1] "
