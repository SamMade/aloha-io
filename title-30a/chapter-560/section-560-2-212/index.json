If the election is exercised on behalf of a surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary who is an incapacitated person, that portion of the elective-share and supplemental elective-share amounts due from the decedent&amp;rsquo;s probate estate and recipients of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s nonprobate transfers to others under section 560:2-209(b) and &amp;copy; must be placed in a custodial trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary under chapter 554B, except as modified below.

The custodial trustee may make such a determination when, for example, the sole remaining asset of the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is the spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s residence, or similar factors would exist that would make use or liquidation of the surviving spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s own assets inappropriate; (3) Upon the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s death, the custodial trustee shall transfer the unexpended custodial trust property in the following order: (A) Under the residuary clause, if any, of the will of the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s predeceased spouse or reciprocal beneficiary against whom the elective share was taken, as if that predeceased spouse or reciprocal beneficiary died immediately after the beneficiary; or (B) To that predeceased spouse&amp;rsquo;s or reciprocal beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s heirs under section 560:2-711.
