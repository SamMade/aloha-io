A contract to make a will or devise, or not to revoke a will or devise, or to die intestate, if executed after January 1, 1997, may be established only by: (1) Provisions of a will stating material provisions of the contract; (2) An express reference in a will to a contract and extrinsic evidence proving the terms of the contract; or (3) A writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract. The execution of a joint will or mutual wills does not create a presumption of a contract not to revoke the will or wills. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1] Revision Note &amp;ldquo;January 1, 1997&amp;rdquo; substituted for &amp;ldquo;the effective date of this article&amp;rdquo;. "
