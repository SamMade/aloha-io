  "context": "§560:3-108 Probate, testacy and appointment proceedings; ultimate time limit. (a) No informal probate or appointment proceeding or formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than a proceeding to probate a will previously probated at the testator&amp;rsquo;s domicile and appointment proceedings relating to an estate in which there has been a prior appointment, may be commenced more than five years after the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death, except: (1) If a previous proceeding was dismissed because of doubt about the fact of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death, appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained at any time thereafter upon a finding that the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death occurred before the initiation of the previous proceeding and the applicant or petitioner has not delayed unduly in initiating the subsequent proceeding; (2) Appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained in relation to the estate of an absent, disappeared or missing person for whose estate a conservator has been appointed, at any time within three years after the conservator becomes able to establish the death of the protected person; (3) A proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointment of the person with legal priority for appointment if the contest is successful, may be commenced within: (A) Ninety days after receiving notice of an informal proceeding pursuant to section 560:3-306; (B) Twelve months from the date the will was informally admitted to probate; or &amp;copy; Thirty days from the entry of a formal order approving the accounts and settlement of the estate by an informally appointed personal representative, whichever time period expires first. If an informal proceeding is closed informally, the court in its discretion may allow a will contest to proceed after the limitations period has expired if it determines that notice of the informal probate proceedings was not provided pursuant to section 560:3-306 and not more than five years has elapsed since the decedents death; (4) An informal appointment or a formal testacy or appointment proceeding may be commenced thereafter if no proceedings concerning the succession or estate administration have occurred within the five year period after decedent&amp;rsquo;s death, but the personal representative has no right to possess estate assets as provided in section 560:3-709 beyond that necessary to confirm title thereto in the successors to the estate and claims other than expenses of administration may not be presented against the estate; and (5) A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced at any time after five years from the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death if, in the discretion of the court it would be equitable to do so, for the purpose of establishing an instrument to direct or control the ownership of property passing or distributable after the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death from one other than the decedent when the property is to be appointed by the terms of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s will or is to pass or be distributed as a part of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s estate or its transfer is otherwise to be controlled by the terms of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s will. (b) These limitations do not apply to proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs of an intestate. &amp;copy; In cases under subsection (a)(1) or (2) the date on which a testacy or appointment proceeding is properly commenced shall be deemed to be the date of the decedent&amp;rsquo;s death for purposes of other limitations provisions of this chapter which relate to the date of death.
