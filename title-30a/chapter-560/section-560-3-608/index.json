  "context": "ยง560:3-608 Termination of appointment; general. Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in sections 560:3-609 to 560:3-612. Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by this chapter or any will, except that a personal representative, at any time prior to distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform acts necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a successor representative. Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve the personal representative of the duty to preserve assets subject to the personal representative&amp;rsquo;s control, to account therefor and to deliver the assets. Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative, but terminates the personal representative&amp;rsquo;s authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1] "
