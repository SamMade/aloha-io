The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed which are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to the person&amp;rsquo;s appointment the same effect as those occurring thereafter. Prior to the person&amp;rsquo;s appointment, a person named executor in a will may carry out written instructions of the decedent relating to the decedent&amp;rsquo;s body, funeral, and burial arrangements. A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the estate done by others where the acts would have been proper for a personal representative. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1] "
