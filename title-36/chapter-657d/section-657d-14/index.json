  "context": "[ยง657D-14] Restrictions. (a) In any action or proceeding commenced in any court, if an insurance policy was assigned prior to the person&amp;rsquo;s period of military service to secure the payment of any obligation of that person, no assignee of the policy (except the insurer in connection with a policy loan), during the period of military service of the insured or within sixty days thereafter, except upon the consent in writing of the insured made during the period or when the premiums thereon are due and unpaid or upon the death of the insured, shall exercise any right or option by virtue of the assignment unless upon leave of court granted upon an application made by the assignee. The court may refuse to grant leave unless the court finds that the ability of the obligor to comply with the terms of the obligation is not materially affected by reason of the obligor&amp;rsquo;s military service. For the purpose of this subsection, premiums which are guaranteed under part IV shall not be deemed to be due and unpaid. (b) No person shall exercise any right to foreclose or enforce any lien for storage of household goods, furniture, or personal effects of a person in military service during the person&amp;rsquo;s period of military service and for sixty days thereafter except upon an order previously granted by a court upon application and a return made and approved by the court. The court, after a hearing on an application by the person in military service or some person on behalf of the person in military service, unless in the opinion of the court the ability of the defendant to pay the storage charges due is not materially affected by reason of the person&amp;rsquo;s military service, may find against a person in military service. &amp;copy; Before or during the period of that service, or within sixty days thereafter, the court, on its own motion or on application to it by such person or a person on such person&amp;rsquo;s behalf, unless in the opinion of the court the ability of the defendant to comply with the judgment or order entered or sought is not materially affected by reason of the defendant&amp;rsquo;s service shall: (1) Stay the execution of any judgment or order entered against this person, as provided in this chapter; or (2) Vacate or stay any attachment or garnishment of property, money, or debts in the hands of another, whether before or after judgment as provided in this chapter.
