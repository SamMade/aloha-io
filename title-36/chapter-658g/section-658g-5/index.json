(b) A tribunal may not order a party to participate in a collaborative law process over that party&amp;rsquo;s objection. &amp;copy; A collaborative law process is concluded by: (1) The resolution of a collaborative matter as evidenced by a signed record; (2) The resolution of a part of the collaborative matter, evidenced by a signed record, in which the parties agree that the remaining parts of the matter will not be resolved in the process; or (3) The termination of the process. (d) A collaborative law process terminates: (1) When a party gives notice to other parties in a record that the process is ended; or (2) When a party: (A) Begins a proceeding related to a collaborative matter without the agreement of all parties; or (B) In a pending proceeding related to the matter: (i) Initiates a pleading, motion, order to show cause, or request for a conference with the tribunal; (ii) Requests that the proceeding be put on the tribunal&amp;rsquo;s active calendar; or (iii) Takes similar action requiring notice to be sent to the parties; or (3) Except as otherwise provided by subsection (e), when a party discharges a collaborative lawyer or a collaborative lawyer withdraws from further representation of a party. (e) A party&amp;rsquo;s collaborative lawyer shall give prompt notice to all other parties in a record of a discharge or withdrawal. (f) A party may terminate a collaborative law process with or without cause. (g) Notwithstanding the discharge or withdrawal of a collaborative lawyer, a collaborative law process continues, if not later than thirty days after the date that the notice of the discharge or withdrawal of a collaborative lawyer required by subsection (d)(3) is sent to the parties: (1) The unrepresented party engages a successor collaborative lawyer; and (2) In a signed record: (A) The parties consent to continue the process by reaffirming the collaborative law participation agreement; (B) The agreement is amended to identify the successor collaborative lawyer; and &amp;copy; The successor collaborative lawyer confirms the lawyer&amp;rsquo;s representation of a party in the collaborative process. (h) A collaborative law process does not conclude if, with the consent of the parties, a party requests a tribunal to approve a resolution of the collaborative matter or any part thereof as evidenced by a signed record. (i) A collaborative law participation agreement may provide additional methods of concluding a collaborative law process. [L 2012, c 207, pt of ยง1] "
