(b) After a collaborative law process concludes, another lawyer in a law firm with which a collaborative lawyer disqualified under section 658G-9(a) is associated may represent a party without fee in the collaborative matter or a matter related to the collaborative matter if: (1) The party has an annual income that qualifies the party for free legal representation under the criteria established by the law firm for free legal representation; (2) The collaborative law participation agreement so provides; and (3) The collaborative lawyer is isolated from any participation in the collaborative matter or a matter related to the collaborative matter through procedures within the law firm which are reasonably calculated to isolate the collaborative lawyer from that participation.
