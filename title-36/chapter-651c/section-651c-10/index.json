  "context": "[§651C-10] Supplement of provisions. Unless displaced by the provisions of this chapter, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relating to principal and agent, estoppel, laches, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, insolvency, or other validating or invalidating cause, supplement its provisions. [L 1985, c 216, pt of §1] Case Notes Petitioners were entitled to a variety of means (§§651C-7 and 651C-8 and this section) to secure a full recovery of their losses from respondent and/or the asset fraudulently transferred to respondent, but only once, not twice; moreover, nothing in this chapter requires petitioners to elect one remedy over another. This chapter does not, however, allow petitioners recovery of both the asset transferred (regardless of its value) and, in addition, a judgment in the full amount of their damages. 130 H. 58 (App.), 305 P.3d 474 (2013).
