  "context": "[ยง651C-4] Transfers fraudulent as to present and future creditors. (a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor&amp;rsquo;s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation: (1) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or (2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debtor: (A) Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or (B) Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that the debtor would incur, debts beyond the debtor&amp;rsquo;s ability to pay as they became due. (b) In determining actual intent under subsection (a)(1), consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether: (1) The transfer or obligation was to an insider; (2) The debtor had retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer; (3) The transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed; (4) Before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor was sued or threatened with suit; (5) The transfer was of substantially all the debtor&amp;rsquo;s assets; (6) The debtor had absconded; (7) The debtor had removed or concealed assets; (8) The value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred; (9) The debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred; (10) The transfer had occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and (11) The debtor had transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who had transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor. [L 1985, c 216, pt of ยง1] Case Notes Fraudulent transfers, discussed. 916 F.2d 528 (1990). Plaintiffs pled facts with sufficient particularity to support a cause of action for fraudulent conveyance under subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2)(B) and ยง651C-5(a). 529 F. Supp. 2d 1190 (2007). Although Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s uniform fraudulent transfer act does not preclude preferential transfers per se, if the preferential transfer was made with &amp;ldquo;actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor&amp;rdquo; the transfer will be deemed fraudulent. 113 H. 174, 150 P.3d 823 (2006). Mentioned: 130 H. 58 (App.), 305 P.3d 474 (2013). "
