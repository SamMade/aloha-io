  "context": "[ยง658B-6] Asserting and defending a foreign-money claim. (a) A claimant may assert a claim in a specified foreign money. If a foreign money is not asserted, the claimant makes a claim for a judgment in United States dollars. (b) An opposing party may allege and prove that the claim is, in whole or in part, for a different money than that asserted by the claimant. &amp;copy; Any party may assert a defense, set-off, recoupment, or counterclaim in any money without regard to the money of other claims. (d) The determination of the proper money of the claim is a question of law. [L 1990, c 50, pt of ยง1] "
