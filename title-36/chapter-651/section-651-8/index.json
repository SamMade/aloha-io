  "context": "§651-8 Amount levied on. The police officer shall attach a sufficient amount of the property of the defendant if sufficient not exempt from execution can be found, giving that to which the defendant has an unquestionable title a preference over that to which the defendant&amp;rsquo;s title is doubtful. The police officer shall, as nearly as the circumstances of the case will permit, levy upon property twenty per cent greater in value than the amount which the plaintiff in the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s affidavit claims to be due. When property is seized on attachment, the court may allow to the officer having charge thereof such compensation for the officer&amp;rsquo;s trouble and expenses in keeping the same as is reasonable and just.
