If any officer levies or is about to levy an attachment or execution on any property claimed as exempt under subpart C, and a doubt arises as to the liability of the property to be seized or sold, the officer may demand of the plaintiff a bond with sufficient sureties, payable to the officer, in a sufficient penalty, conditioned to indemnify and save harmless the officer against all damages, costs, and expenses which the officer may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of the property. If the bond is not given after twenty-four hours&amp;rsquo; notice in writing from the officer to the plaintiff, the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s agent, or attorney, if it is required, the officer may refuse to levy, or, having levied, may dismiss the levy. If the required bond is given, the officer shall seize and sell or dispose of the property according to the command of the process in the officer&amp;rsquo;s hands.
