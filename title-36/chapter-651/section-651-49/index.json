No sale by execution shall operate to convey a greater estate or interest in the property sold, than the defendant in execution had at the time of sale; and all such sales of property not belonging to the defendant shall subject the officer to the private action of the purchaser, being afterwards deprived thereof by the real owner. [CC 1859, §1027; RL 1925, §2451; RL 1935, §4152; RL 1945, §10179; RL 1955, §233-48; HRS §651-49] Case Notes Liability of plaintiff in execution when sheriff sells more than the defendant&amp;rsquo;s share. 2 H. 178 (1859).
