After a party to an arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the party may make a motion to the court for an order confirming the award at which time the court shall issue a confirming order unless the award is modified or corrected pursuant to section 658A-20 or 658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section 658A-23. [L 2001, c 265, pt of ยง1] Case Notes Although insurer contended that because award had already been paid, motion to confirm the award had been rendered moot, as the plain language of this section requires the circuit court to confirm an award unless the award has been vacated, modified, or corrected, circuit court did not err in confirming the arbitration award. 122 H. 393 (App.), 227 P.3d 559 (2010).
