  "context": "[ยง658A-25] Judgment on award; attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees and litigation expenses. (a) Upon granting an order confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award, the court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith. The judgment may be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any other judgment in a civil action. (b) A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion and subsequent judicial proceedings. &amp;copy; On application of a prevailing party to a contested judicial proceeding under section 658A-22, 658A-23, or 658A-24, the court may add reasonable attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in a judicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgment confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award. [L 2001, c 265, pt of ยง1] Case Notes Subsection (a), which enumerates the appeals that may be taken from a court order concerning an arbitration proceeding, does not represent an exclusive list of appealable orders; thus, although not listed in subsection (a), order compelling arbitration was sufficiently final under the collateral order doctrine to be appealable under ยง641-1. 129 H. 378, 301 P.3d 588 (2013). Under subsection &amp;copy;, union-appellant, representative of real party in interest city worker, was not entitled to an award of attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees incurred during a proceeding filed against worker&amp;rsquo;s employer to enforce an uncontested judgment confirming an arbitration award. 119 H. 201 (App.), 194 P.3d 1163 (2008).
