      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Civil action arising from sexual offenses;</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง657-1.8 Civil action arising from sexual offenses; application; certificate of merit.</strong> (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, except as provided under subsection (b), no action for recovery of damages based on physical, psychological, or other injury or condition suffered by a minor arising from the sexual abuse of the minor by any person shall be commenced against the person who committed the act of sexual abuse more than:</p>

<p>(1) Eight years after the eighteenth birthday of the minor or the person who committed the act of sexual abuse attains the age of majority, whichever occurs later; or</p>

<p>(2) Three years after the date the minor discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of minor&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday was caused by the sexual abuse,</p>

<p>whichever comes later.</p>

<p>A civil cause of action for the sexual abuse of a minor shall be based upon sexual acts that constituted or would have constituted a criminal offense under part V or VI of chapter 707.</p>

<p>(b) For a period of four years after April 24, 2012, a victim of child sexual abuse that occurred in this State may file a claim in a circuit court of this State against the person who committed the act of sexual abuse if the victim is barred from filing a claim against the victim&rsquo;s abuser due to the expiration of the applicable civil statute of limitations that was in effect prior to April 24, 2012.</p>

<p>A claim may also be brought under this subsection against a legal entity if:</p>

<p>(1) The person who committed the act of sexual abuse against the victim was employed by an institution, agency, firm, business, corporation, or other public or private legal entity that owed a duty of care to the victim; or</p>

<p>(2) The person who committed the act of sexual abuse and the victim were engaged in an activity over which the legal entity had a degree of responsibility or control.</p>

<p>Damages against the legal entity shall be awarded under this subsection only if there is a finding of gross negligence on the part of the legal entity.</p>

<p>&copy; A defendant against whom a civil action is commenced may recover attorney&rsquo;s fees if the court determines that a false accusation was made with no basis in fact and with malicious intent. A verdict in favor of the defendant shall not be the sole basis for a determination that an accusation had no basis in fact and was made with malicious intent. The court shall make an independent finding of an improper motive prior to awarding attorney&rsquo;s fees under this section.</p>

<p>(d) In any civil action filed pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), a certificate of merit shall be filed by the attorney for the plaintiff, and shall be sealed and remain confidential. The certificate of merit shall include a notarized statement by a:</p>

<p>(1) Psychologist licensed pursuant to chapter 465;</p>

<p>(2) Marriage and family therapist licensed pursuant to chapter 451J;</p>

<p>(3) Mental health counselor licensed pursuant to chapter 453D; or</p>

<p>(4) Clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 467E;</p>

<p>who is knowledgeable in the relevant facts and issues involved in the action, who is not a party to the action.</p>

<p>The notarized statement included in the certificate of merit shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and opinions relied upon to conclude that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the plaintiff was subject to one or more acts that would result in an injury or condition specified in <a href="a">subsection</a>.
