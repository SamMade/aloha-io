Supp. 787 (1994). Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property (§657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a &amp;ldquo;personal injury&amp;rdquo;, and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of this section (§657-1(4)). 986 F.

Supp. 2d 1013 (2008). Doctrine of anticipatory repudiation did not apply to the statute of limitations on plaintiff insured&amp;rsquo;s breach of contract claim where plaintiff claimed that plaintiff fully performed under the life insurance policy and defendant insurers&amp;rsquo; time for performance had not yet arrived; consequently, plaintiff could not bring an action for breach of contract because it was untimely and, thus, defendant&amp;rsquo;s motion for summary judgment was granted. 792 F.
