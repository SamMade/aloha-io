When a defendant, against whom action has been timely brought, brings in a third-party defendant who is or may be liable to the defendant or to the plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claim against the defendant, plaintiff within thirty days after the date of filing of the third-party defendant&amp;rsquo;s answer, may assert against the third-party defendant any claim, arising out of the original transaction or occurrence that is also the subject matter of the third-party plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claim against the third-party defendant, which would have been timely if the third-party defendant had been joined originally as a defendant, notwithstanding any statutory period of limitations otherwise applicable to plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claim. Nothing herein shall preclude the plaintiff from asserting any claim which the plaintiff might have asserted without the benefit of this section. [L 1972, c 186, ยง2; gen ch 1985] Case Notes Section does not preclude identification on the record of John Doe defendants after thirty days from the filing of a third-party complaint naming them. 2 H. App. 373, 636 P.2d 1352 (1981). "
