(a) After the purchaser completes the purchase by paying the full purchase price and the costs for the purchase, the mortgaged property shall be conveyed to the purchaser by a conveyance document. The conveyance document shall be in a recordable form and shall be signed by the foreclosing mortgagee in the foreclosing mortgagee&amp;rsquo;s name. The mortgagor or borrower shall not be required to sign the conveyance document. (b) From the sale proceeds, after paying all liens and encumbrances in the order of priority as a matter of law, after paying the foreclosing mortgagee&amp;rsquo;s attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees and costs, after paying the fees and costs of the power of sale foreclosure, and after paying the moneys owed to the foreclosing mortgagee, the balance of the sale proceeds shall be distributed by the foreclosing mortgagee to junior creditors having valid liens on the mortgaged property in the order of their priority and not pro rata. Any remaining surplus after payment in full of all valid lien creditors shall be distributed to the mortgagor. &amp;copy; Lien creditors prior to the foreclosing mortgagee shall not be forced to their right of recovery. However, the foreclosing mortgagee and any prior lien creditor may agree in writing that the proceeds from the sale will be distributed by the foreclosing mortgagee to the prior lien creditor towards the payment of moneys owed to the prior lien creditor before any moneys are paid to the foreclosing mortgagee.
