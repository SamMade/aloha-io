(b) This section applies to the following felonies: (1) Murder in the first or second degree; (2) Attempted murder in the first or second degree; (3) Any class A felony as provided in the Hawaii Penal Code, including any attempt or conspiracy to commit a crime classified as a class A felony; (4) Any class B felony involving violence or physical harm as provided in the Hawaii Penal Code; (5) Any felony punishable by imprisonment for life; (6) Any other felony in which the person inflicts serious bodily injury on another person; and (7) Any felony in which the person personally used a firearm or a dangerous or deadly weapon. &amp;copy; The limitation on liability under this section arises: (1) At the moment the perpetrator commences the felony to which this section applies; or (2) At the moment the owner or agent of the owner lawfully on the premises by consent of the owner believes that a commission of a felony under subsection (b) is imminent; and extends to the moment the perpetrator is no longer upon the property. (d) The limitation on liability under this section applies only when the perpetrator&amp;rsquo;s conduct in furtherance of the commission of a felony specified in subsection (b) proximately or legally causes the injury or death. (e) This section does not limit the liability of an owner that otherwise exists for: (1) Wilful, wanton, or criminal conduct; or (2) Wilful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, or structure; or (3) Injury or death caused to individuals other than the perpetrator of the felony. (f) Except with regard to subsections(1) and (e)(3), the limitation of liability under this section shall not be affected by the failure of the owner to warn the perpetrator of the felony that the owner is armed and ready to cause bodily harm or death. (g) For purposes of this section, &amp;ldquo;owner&amp;rdquo; means the owner, the occupant, tenant, or anyone authorized to be on the property by the owner or the occupant, including a guest or a family or household member, employee, or agent of the owner lawfully on the premises.
