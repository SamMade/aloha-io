  "context": "[ยง663-1.55] Volunteer firefighters; limited liability. Any volunteer firefighter who in good faith renders firefighting services shall not be liable for any civil damages resulting from the person&amp;rsquo;s acts or omissions occurring during the course of firefighting, except for such damages as may result from the person&amp;rsquo;s gross negligence, or wanton acts or omissions. For purposes of this section, volunteer firefighter means any person who trains as a volunteer firefighter and who, of the person&amp;rsquo;s own free will, provides firefighting services in a fire emergency without remuneration or expectation of remuneration. For purposes of this section, good faith includes, but is not limited to, a reasonable opinion that the immediacy of a fire is such that the rendering of firefighting service should not be postponed.
