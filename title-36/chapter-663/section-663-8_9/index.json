(a) No party shall be liable for the negligent infliction of serious emotional distress or disturbance if the distress or disturbance arises solely out of damage to property or material objects. (b) This section shall not apply if the serious emotional distress or disturbance results in physical injury to or mental illness of the person who experiences the emotional distress or disturbance. [L Sp 1986, c 2, ยง22] Case Notes Defendants&amp;rsquo; motion for summary judgment on all negligent infliction of emotional distress claims granted, where plaintiffs-intervenors had not even alleged physical injury or a diagnosed illness. 535 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (2008). Because a corpse is neither &amp;ldquo;property&amp;rdquo; nor a &amp;ldquo;material object&amp;rdquo; for purposes of this section, this section does not apply to negligent infliction of emotional distress claims arising from the negligent mishandling of a corpse. 96 H. 147, 28 P.3d 982 (2001). Cited: 895 F. Supp. 1365 (1995). Mentioned: 900 F. Supp. 1339 (1995); 907 F. Supp. 2d 1165 (2012). "
