  "context": "§662-5 Jury. Any action against the State under this chapter shall be tried by the court without a jury; provided that the court, with the consent of all the parties, may order a trial with a jury whose verdict shall have the same effect as if trial by jury had been a matter of right. [L 1957, c 312, pt of §1; Supp, §245A-5; HRS §662-5; am L 1979, c 152, §2] Case Notes This section held not to entitle county of Hawaii to nonjury trial. 57 H. 656, 562 P.2d 436 (1977). Consent to trial cannot be involuntary or implied. 6 H. App. 582, 733 P.2d 1224 (1987). Read together, this section acts as a limitation on the general state tort liability waiver found in §662-2, and the general waiver thus does not provide a right to a jury trial for tort actions against state entities; therefore, the circuit court did not err in independently determining the state hospital&amp;rsquo;s liability, resulting in joint and several damages different from those &amp;ldquo;awarded&amp;rdquo; by the jury. 127 H. 325 (App.), 278 P.3d 382 (2012). Read together with this section, §663-10.9(3) requires the imposition of joint and several liability only as adjudicated by the court, not the jury; having determined that the state hospital&amp;rsquo;s individual degree of negligence was more than twenty-five per cent, the circuit court properly awarded joint and several damages against the hospital to the full extent that the court determined patient&amp;rsquo;s injuries to arise out of the subject incident, and therefore complied with §663-10.9(3). 127 H. 325 (App.), 278 P.3d 382 (2012).
