In case the court finds it to be inequitable or inexpedient to establish a fence between adjoining lands, either because of the nature or situation of the lands, the shortness of the unexpired term of a lease or agreement, the scarcity of fencing materials, or the conflicting rights of the parties, it may, if the lands are grazing lands, in lieu of fencing, decide how many animals each owner, lessee, or occupant shall be at liberty to pasture upon the owner&amp;rsquo;s, lessee&amp;rsquo;s, or occupant&amp;rsquo;s land under a penalty to be specified in the decree.
