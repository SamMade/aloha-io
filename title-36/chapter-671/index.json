General Provisions Section 671-1 Definitions 671-2 Repealed 671-3 Informed consent 671-4 Notice of damages 671-5 Reporting and reviewing medical tort claims 671-6 Administration of chapter 671-7 Professional liability insurance; coverage for telehealth Part II. Medical Inquiry and Conciliation 671-11 Medical inquiry and conciliation panels; composition, selection, compensation 671-11.5 Waiver of filing fee  671-12 Review by panel required; notice; presentation of inquiry; request for a more definite statement of the inquiry 671-12.5 Certificate of consultation  671-13 Medical inquiry and conciliation panel proceedings; voluntary settlement  671-14 Same; persons attending proceedings of panel  671-15 Panel termination  671-15.5 Expungement of records; malpractice insurance rates 671-16 Subsequent litigation; excluded evidence  671-16.5 Arbitration; subsequent litigation  671-16.6 Submission of inquiry to an alternative dispute resolution provider  671-17 Immunity of panel members from liability 671-18 Statute of limitations tolled 671-19 Duty to cooperate; assessment of costs and fees 671-20 Annual report Part III. Patients&amp;rsquo; Compensation Fund&amp;ndash;Repealed 671-31 to 37 Repealed Case Notes As chapter rationally furthers legitimate state interest of assuring the provision of affordable health care to Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s citizens by requiring participation in medical malpractice dispute resolution such that the high cost of litigation may be avoided, plaintiff not denied equal protection of the laws. 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998). Section 671-12(a) requires only that a claimant set forth facts upon which the claim is based and include the names of all parties against whom the claim is or may be made who are then known to the claimant; nowhere in §671-12 does it require plaintiffs to name all known negligent health care providers; having filed the requisite medical claim conciliation panel claim, participated in the required hearing, and rejected the panel&amp;rsquo;s finding of no actionable negligence, plaintiffs satisfied this chapter&amp;rsquo;s statutory prerequisites for filing suit in circuit court. 111 H. 74, 137 P.3d 980 (2006). Where defendant was a Hawaii nonprofit organization, which served as the parent corporation of four affiliated hospitals in Hawaii, including Kapiolani, a wholly-owned subsidiary of defendant, defendant was a &amp;ldquo;health care provider&amp;rdquo; in the context of this chapter. 121 H. 235 (App.), 216 P.3d 1258 (2009). Plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claims of neglect, abuse, and failure to provide a safe home against care home defendants did not constitute &amp;ldquo;medical torts&amp;rdquo; within the meaning of §671-1; thus, plaintiff was not required to submit plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claims to a medical claim conciliation panel (MCCP) pursuant to §§671-12 and 671-16 as a condition for plaintiff to file suit against defendants, and the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s suit based on plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s failure to submit plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claims to a MCCP. 128 H. 405 (App.), 289 P.3d 1041 (2012).
