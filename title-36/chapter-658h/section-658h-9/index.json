(a) Before accepting a mediation, an individual who is requested to serve as a mediator shall: (1) Make an inquiry that is reasonable under the circumstances to determine whether there are any known facts that a reasonable individual would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the mediator, including a financial or personal interest in the outcome of the mediation and an existing or past relationship with a mediation party or foreseeable mediation party or nonparty participant in the mediation; and (2) Disclose any such known fact to the mediation parties as soon as is practical before accepting a mediation. (b) If a mediator learns any fact described in subsection (a)(1) after accepting a mediation, the mediator shall disclose it as soon as is practicable. &amp;copy; At the request of a mediation party, an individual who is requested to serve as a mediator shall disclose the mediator&amp;rsquo;s qualifications to mediate a dispute.
