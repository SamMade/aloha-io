  "context": "§666-3 Forfeiture, warning, notice to vacate, refunds. (a) Any tenancy created by or described in section 666-2 shall be subject to forfeiture where the tenant or any invitee or employee of the tenant commits any act, or causes any condition to exist, within or upon the rented premises which act or condition constitutes a nuisance as defined in section 712-1270. (b) A written notice shall first be delivered by the landlord to the tenant warning the tenant to abate or cause to be abated the common nuisance within twenty-four hours from the time the notice is delivered. If the common nuisance complained of remains unabated after twenty-four hours from the time the notice is delivered to the tenant, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by a written notice to vacate the premises within five days from the date the second notice is delivered to the tenant. Where rent has been paid in advance by the tenant, refund shall be made by the landlord of the amount of rent so paid covering the period from the date the rent was paid to and including the date the premises are vacated. If the tenant fails or refuses to vacate the premises within five days from the date of delivery of the second notice, then in case rent has been paid in advance, the landlord shall make a tender of the amount of the refund of rent to which the tenant would have been entitled had the tenant vacated the premises upon the date the notice to vacate was delivered to the tenant. Thereafter, upon the continued failure or refusal on the part of the tenant to vacate, the landlord may proceed, without further notice, to evict the tenant in any manner authorized by law.
