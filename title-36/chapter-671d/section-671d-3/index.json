The legislature finds the following: (1) There is an overriding need to provide incentive and protection for physicians engaging in effective professional peer review; (2) The occurrence of medical malpractice actions has become a problem in Hawaii which can be addressed in part by promoting more effective peer review; and (3) The threat of private money damage liability under state laws unreasonably discourages physicians from participating in effective professional peer review.
