Not later than July 1, 2008, there shall be no distinction between hospital-based and nonhospital-based reimbursement rates for institutionalized long-term care under medicaid. Reimbursement for institutionalized intermediate care facilities and institutionalized skilled nursing facilities shall be based solely on the level of care rather than the location. This section shall not apply to critical access hospitals. [L 1998, c 294, §1; am L 2000, c 226, §§5, 9; am L 2004, c 148, §§1, 2] Note L 2000, c 226, §6 provides: &amp;ldquo;SECTION 6. The State&amp;rsquo;s share of matching funds shall be provided through the Hawaii health systems corporation and other designated critical access hospitals&amp;rsquo; appropriations to the extent funding is available. If funding is not available, medicaid reimbursement to critical access hospitals shall revert back to the existing medicaid payment methodology.&amp;rdquo; "
