  "context": "[ยง352D-1] Finding and purpose. The legislature finds that: (1) The State of Hawaii has the responsibility to provide its youth a fair and full opportunity to reach their full potential and become law-abiding citizens of our community by providing and encouraging services, which will strengthen their physical, emotional, social, educational, and moral development; (2) There is a need for a strong state commitment to the needs of youth and families. Of particular concern are those youth who come into conflict with the laws of our community. To achieve this commitment, there is need for statewide planning and system coordination; oversight of activities and services; and evaluation and monitoring of the effectiveness of these services. In addition, a single entity is needed to serve as a central intake agency, and to coordinate the delivery of services, and provide a continuum of programs to eliminate gaps and provide a clear sense of responsibility and accountability for youth services. This agency must have sufficient statutory authority to ensure that its directives and mandates are complied with by the various affected agencies. The purpose of this chapter is to establish the office of youth services for the planning, case management, and delivery of services to youth at risk. [L 1989, c 375, pt of ยง1] "
