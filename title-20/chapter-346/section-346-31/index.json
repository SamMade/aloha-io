The department of human services as far as permissible under the then existing federal laws, may assign persons in need of public assistance to work on state, county, or other public projects whether or not the projects are conducted in cooperation with any federal agency for the relief of unemployment. The amount of assistance to be paid to such persons shall be fixed by the department, taking into consideration the work performed, and may exceed the amount or value of the grant of public assistance, which would have been made had no such assignment to a work project been made, but in no event shall such additional assistance, granted because of assignment to a work project, exceed the amount necessary to provide for extra expenses, incurred by the recipient for food, clothing, transportation, and incidentals.
