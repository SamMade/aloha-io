      <p><strong>§346-59.9 Psychotropic medication.</strong> (a) This section shall apply only to the medicaid managed care and fee-for-service programs administered by the department when the department or the department&rsquo;s contracted health plan is the primary insurer. When the department is the secondary insurer, the department and its contracted health plans shall be responsible only for the secondary insurers share of any psychotropic medication covered by the primary insurer.</p>

<p>(b) The department and its contracted health plans shall not impose any restriction or limitation on the coverage for, or a recipient&rsquo;s access to, antipsychotic medication.</p>

<p>&copy; The department and its contracted health plans shall not impose any restriction or limitation on the coverage for, or a recipient&rsquo;s access to, antidepressant medication other than:</p>

<p>(1) Requiring that an individual must have two failed attempts on a generic antidepressant medication to receive coverage for a new brand-name antidepressant prescription; and</p>

<p>(2) Requiring that if an individual does not have two failed attempts on a generic antidepressant medication, that individual shall receive coverage for a brand-name antidepressant medication with prior authorization by the contracted health plan; provided that while a prior authorization request for a brand-name antidepressant medication submitted by the prescriber is pending, a supply of the prescribed medication sufficient to last until the request is resolved shall be covered if requested by the prescriber.</p>

<p>For purposes of this subsection, a &ldquo;failed attempt&rdquo; means that the prescribed generic antidepressant medication up to the maximum FDA-approved dosage is not effective in treating the individual, or the individual&rsquo;s compliance is compromised due to the side effects caused by the medication.</p>

<p>(d) The department and its contracted health plans shall not impose any restriction or limitation on the coverage for, or a recipient&rsquo;s access to, anti-anxiety medication other than:</p>

<p>(1) Requiring that an individual must have two failed attempts on a generic anti-anxiety medication to receive coverage for a new brand-name anti-anxiety prescription; and</p>

<p>(2) Requiring that if an individual does not have two failed attempts on a generic anti-anxiety medication, that individual shall receive coverage for a brand-name anti-anxiety medication with prior authorization by the contracted health plan; provided that while a prior authorization request for a brand-name anti-anxiety medication submitted by the prescriber is pending, a supply of the prescribed medication sufficient to last until the request is resolved shall be covered if requested by the prescriber.</p>

<p>For purposes of this subsection, a &ldquo;failed attempt&rdquo; means that the prescribed generic anti-anxiety medication up to the maximum FDA-approved dosage is not effective in treating the individual, or the individual&rsquo;s compliance is compromised due to the side effects caused by the medication.</p>

<p>(e) The department and its contracted health plans shall not require any individual stable on a brand-name antidepressant medication on or before July 1, 2010, to transfer to a different antidepressant medication, generic or brand-name, unless the individual&rsquo;s condition becomes unstable and requires the medication to be replaced.</p>

<p>(f) The department and its contracted health plans shall not require any individual stable on a brand-name anti-anxiety medication on or before July 1, 2010, to transfer to a different anti-anxiety medication, generic or brand-name, unless the individual&rsquo;s condition becomes unstable and requires the medication to be replaced.</p>

<p>(g) The department and its medicaid managed care contracted health plans shall have the authority to investigate fraud, abuse, or misconduct.</p>

<p>(h) The department shall report to the legislature no later than twenty days before the convening of each regular session on:</p>

<p>(1) The number of brand-name and generic prescriptions written to which this section applies; and</p>

<p>(2) The amount expended on brand-name prescriptions and the amount expended on generic prescriptions written each fiscal year to which this section applies.</p>
