<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution did not bar plaintiffs&rsquo; individual suits under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act or §504 of the Rehabilitation Act regarding class action suit based on State&rsquo;s exclusion of certain disabled people from health insurance program; determinations of unlawful discrimination and awards of compensatory damages and expert witness fees affirmed. 303 F.3d 1039 (2002).</p>

<p>Where plaintiffs claimed that Basic Health Hawaii violated the equal protection clause because it provided less health coverage to Compact of Free Association with the United States (COFA) residents than the health coverage that Hawaii provided to citizens and qualified aliens eligible for federal reimbursement through medicaid, plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence that Hawaii had not closely followed the federal direction and adhered to requirements prescribed by Congress. Plaintiffs also did not allege that state expenditures for health insurance for aliens within the discretionary category were less than the state expenditures for health insurance for others. 748 F.3d 875 (2014).</p>

<p>Re cooperation with Federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children regulations in determining eligibility. 396 F. Supp. 375 (1975).</p>

<p>State welfare manual regulations held to violate federal regulations regarding payment of benefits while termination of benefits hearing is pending. 434 F. Supp. 1173 (1977); 434 F. Supp. 1177 (1977).</p>

<p>State regulations not allowing deduction of reasonable work related expenses in determining need and imposing burdensome verification of expenses violated federal regulations. 438 F. Supp. 238 (1977).</p>

<p>Department&rsquo;s manual of instruction covering investigation of fraud dealt only with internal management and was not required to be adopted in accordance with chapter 91. 58 H. 94, 564 P.2d 1271 (1977).</p>
