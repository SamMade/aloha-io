<p>(1) The minor understands the significant benefits, responsibilities, risks, and limits of the shelter and services and can communicate an informed consent;</p>

<p>(2) The minor understands the requirements and rules of the shelter and services; and</p>

<p>(3) The shelter and services are necessary to ensure the minor&rsquo;s safety and well-being;</p>

<p>and the provider has conducted an assessment and determined that the minor does not pose a danger to the minor&rsquo;s self or to other persons at the same location. If the provider determines that admitting the minor poses a danger, the provider shall report the matter to an appropriate agency.</p>

<p>(b) A minor may consent to no cost emergency shelter and related services if the minor understands the benefits, responsibilities, risks, and limits of the shelter and services, and the minor agrees to adhere to the provider&rsquo;s rules and cooperate and participate in those services recommended by the provider; provided that:</p>

<p>(1) The provider has not, despite reasonable efforts, been able to contact the minor&rsquo;s parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian;</p>

<p>(2) The provider has made contact with the minor&rsquo;s parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian, and the minor&rsquo;s parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian has refused to give consent and, based on the information available to the provider, the provider reasonably believes that the minor would incur harm, or would be subject to threatened harm, if the minor returned immediately to the home of the parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian; or</p>

<p>(3) The minor has refused to provide contact information for the minor&rsquo;s parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian, and the provider reasonably believes that the minor would incur harm, or would be subject to threatened harm, if the minor returned immediately to the home of the parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian.</p>

<p>(d) The consent given under this section shall not be subject to later disaffirmance by reason of the minor&rsquo;s minority.</p>

<p>(e) Any provider who renders emergency shelter and related services to a minor pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section and can demonstrate compliance with this section shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability based on the provider&rsquo;s determination to provide the shelter and related services; provided that if a provider&rsquo;s assessment and determination, or conduct in providing emergency shelter and related services, is the result of the provider&rsquo;s gross negligence or wilful or wanton acts or omissions, the provider may be held liable for the provider&rsquo;s gross negligence or wilful or wanton acts or omissions.</p>

<p>(f) A provider who renders emergency shelter and related services to a minor shall document in writing the efforts made to contact the minor&rsquo;s parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian.</p>

<p>(g) The provider shall report any suspected child abuse or neglect to the department or the police department in accordance with section 350-1.1.</p>
