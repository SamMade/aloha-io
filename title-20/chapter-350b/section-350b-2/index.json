(d) The fund may receive contributions, grants, or gifts in cash or otherwise from all sources. The legislature intends that the public and private sectors work together as partners in securing contributions for the fund. The State may donate moneys to the trust fund by legislative appropriation; provided that any appropriations made by the State are not intended to supplant the funding of existing prevention programs. (e) There shall be an endowment component of the Hawaii children&amp;rsquo;s trust fund. (f) The aggregate principal sum deposited in the Hawaii children&amp;rsquo;s trust fund, and any income and capital gains earned by the trust fund but not expended for grantmaking or administration, shall be invested in accordance with the provisions of the Hawaii Community Foundation in a manner intended to maximize the rate of return on investment of the trust fund consistent with the objective of preserving the trust fund&amp;rsquo;s principal. (g) The department of health shall serve as the lead agency for the public sector and, in conjunction with the Hawaii Community Foundation, may provide staffing for the board, the coalition, and advisory committee. (h) Results of the annual audit of the Hawaii Community Foundation shall be submitted to the department of health not later than thirty days from the date the Hawaii Community Foundation receives the audit results.
