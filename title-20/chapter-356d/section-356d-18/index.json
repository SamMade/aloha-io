If a receiver is appointed, the receiver may enter and take possession of the public housing project or any part or parts thereof, operate and maintain the project, and collect and receive all fees, rents, revenues, or other charges thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the authority itself might do and shall keep the moneys in a separate account or accounts and apply the moneys in accordance with the obligations of the authority as the court shall direct; and (5) By suit, action, or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction to require the authority and the members of the board thereof to account as if it and they were the trustees of an express trust.
