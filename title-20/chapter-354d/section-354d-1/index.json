The legislature finds that the number and types of programs operated by the department of public safety shall be expanded to provide a comprehensive work program for inmates. The full development of inmate employment opportunities shall be expanded to enable correctional industries programs to operate in a cost-effective manner. The purpose of this chapter is to: (1) Establish the correctional industries program to allow expanded industries programs to generate revenue to sustain its operation and allow for capital investment. The program should be structured to allow for the increased involvement of correctional industries in providing specific training skills for offenders that increase their employment prospects after release; (2) Develop industries that provide a maximum level of work for all qualified, able-bodied inmates; (3) Provide an environment for the operation of correctional industries similar to that of a private business operation; (4) Encourage cooperative training ventures between the correctional industries program and the private sector; and (5) Provide for low-cost construction, renovation, and repairs of facilities, grounds, furniture, vehicles, and equipment for private nonprofit social service, education, and health agencies and programs.
