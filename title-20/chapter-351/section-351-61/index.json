Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any order for the payment of compensation under this chapter may be made on such terms as the commission deems appropriate. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the order may provide for apportionment of the compensation, for the holding of the compensation or any part thereof in trust, for the payment of the compensation in a lump sum or periodic installments, and for the payment of compensation for hospital, medical, funeral, or burial expenses directly to the person who has provided such services.
