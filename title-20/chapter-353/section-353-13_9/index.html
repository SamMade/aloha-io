      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Hearing on petition</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง353-13.9</strong> <strong>Hearing on petition.</strong> (a) The court may adjourn or continue a hearing for failure to timely notify either the person&rsquo;s legal guardian or emergency contact listed while in the custody of the department, or other person determined by the court to be entitled to notice, or for failure by the person who is the subject of the petition to contact an attorney as provided in section 353-13.8, if the court determines that an adjournment or continuance is in the interest of justice.</p>

<p>(b) Unless the hearing is waived, the court shall hear the petition as soon as possible and no later than ten days after the date the petition is filed unless a reasonable delay is sought for good cause shown by the person who is the subject of the petition, the person&rsquo;s attorney, the petitioner, the guardian or guardian ad litem, or those persons entitled to receive notice of the hearing under section 353-13.8.</p>

<p>&copy; The person who is the subject of the petition shall be present at all hearings unless the person waives the right to be present, is unable to attend, or creates conditions that make it impossible to conduct the hearing in a reasonable manner as determined by the court. A waiver is valid only upon acceptance by the court following a judicial determination that the person understands the person&rsquo;s rights and is competent to waive them, or is unable to participate. At any point during the proceedings and after the filing of the petition, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem or a temporary guardian, as provided in article V of chapter 560, to represent the person throughout the proceedings, if the court finds that the person is unable to participate or that other good cause exists.</p>

<p>(d) Hearings may be held at a convenient location within the circuit where the person who is the subject of the petition resides or any other circuit deemed appropriate by the court. The person or any interested person may request a hearing in another circuit because of convenience to the parties, witnesses, or the court, or because of the person&rsquo;s mental or physical condition.</p>

<p>(e) The attorney general, the attorney general&rsquo;s deputy, special deputy, or appointee shall present the case for hearings convened under this section.</p>

<p>(f) Counsel for the person who is the subject of the petition shall be allowed adequate time for investigation of the matters at issue and for preparation, and shall be permitted to present evidence that the counsel believes necessary to a proper disposition of the proceedings.</p>

<p>(g) No person who is the subject of the petition shall be found to require care or treatment unless at least one physician or psychologist who has personally examined or attempted to examine the person testifies in person at the hearing. This testimony may be waived by the person. If the subject has refused to be examined by a licensed physician or psychologist, the person may be examined by a court-appointed licensed physician or psychologist. If the person refuses and there is sufficient evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, the person&rsquo;s refusal shall be treated as a denial that the person is in need of involuntary medical treatment. Nothing in this section shall limit the person&rsquo;s privilege against self-incrimination.</p>

<p>(h) The person who is the subject of the petition in a hearing under this section has the right to secure an independent medical or psychological evaluation at the person&rsquo;s own expense and present evidence thereon.</p>

<p>(i) If the court finds that the criteria for involuntary medical treatment under section 353-13.6 have been met by clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order to authorize the department to involuntarily medically treat the person for a period of up to one year unless the person is sooner released or sooner determined to no longer be in need of treatment. If so specified by the court, however, the order may remain in effect if the person who is the subject of the petition is released but returns to custody during the maximum period of the order, if the underlying criminal case is still active or the sentence has not been fully served, unless the person is sooner determined to no longer be in need of treatment.</p>

<p>(j) The court may find that the person who is the subject of the petition is an incapacitated or protected person, or both, under article V of chapter 560, and may appoint a guardian or conservator, or both, for the person under the terms and conditions as the court shall determine.</p>

<p>(k) Prior to the expiration of an existing involuntary treatment order, the department may move for an extension of the order for a period of up to one year. An extension may be ordered by the court upon a showing that the subject of the order continues to meet the criteria set forth in section 353-13.6. Any extension request shall follow the notice requirements set forth in section 353-13.8. [L 2011, c 72, pt of ยง2; am L 2016, c 35, ยง4]</p>
