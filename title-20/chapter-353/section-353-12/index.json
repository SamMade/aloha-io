The director or a designated agent shall file all warrants, mittimuses, processes, and other official papers, or the attested copies of them, by which any committed person has been committed, paroled, liberated, or retaken and they shall be safely kept in a suitable box or safe. Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of the person so having custody of the papers, they shall be delivered, together with all other official records, papers, and journals, to the person&amp;rsquo;s successor or to any other officer or person duly appointed to receive them. In default of such delivery the director or a designated agent, as the case may be, if living, may be held liable for theft as provided by section 708-830, and shall also be civilly liable in damages to any other person who is injured by such nondelivery.

In addition to the civil liability, the person or the person&amp;rsquo;s personal representatives and sureties on the official bond shall forfeit and pay for each such default in delivery the sum of $200 to be recovered for the use of the general fund of the State.
