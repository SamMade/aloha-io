(a) The director or a designated agent may grant furloughs to committed persons with a minimum or lower security classification in any correctional facility of the department for the purpose of employment, social reorientation, education, or training, or any other valid purpose as determined by the director. Special out-of-state furloughs may be granted to those already otherwise furloughed, at no cost to the State, when death or critical illness or injury to the committed person&amp;rsquo;s immediate family including a reciprocal beneficiary, occurs. Any committed person who is engaged in private employment, by contract or otherwise, not under the immediate custody of the State shall not be considered an agent or employee of the State. Any moneys earned from employment by such person shall be used to satisfy a restitution order and to reimburse the State for the cost of room and board. If any earned moneys remain after these expenses have been paid, that amount shall be held in an individual account for the committed person. When an inmate is granted a special out-of-state furlough, the director shall inform the authorities of the state to which the inmate is to be furloughed of the inmate&amp;rsquo;s arrival. (b) Full power to enforce the terms and conditions of furlough and to retake and reincarcerate a furloughed committed person is conferred upon the director or designated agent. The director or a designated agent, at any time, may issue a warrant authorizing the arrest and return to actual custody of any furloughed committed person for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the terms and conditions of furlough have been violated so as to justify revoking the furlough and to retake and reincarcerate the furloughed committed person. The administrators of all of the correctional facilities of the State, the chief of police of each county, all police officers of the State, and all correctional facility officials shall execute any such warrant of arrest in like manner as an ordinary criminal process. &amp;copy; Any furloughed committed person retaken and reincarcerated as provided in this chapter shall be confined according to the committed person&amp;rsquo;s sentence for that portion of the committed person&amp;rsquo;s term remaining unserved at the time of furlough, but subsequent furloughs, in the discretion of the director or designated agent, may be granted to a committed person during the life and in respect of sentence.
