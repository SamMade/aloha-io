  "context": "ยง353-13.7 Initiation of proceeding for involuntary medical treatment. (a) The director, or the director&amp;rsquo;s designee, may file a petition for involuntary medical treatment alleging that a person in the custody of the department meets the criteria for involuntary medical treatment under section 353-13.6. The petition shall be executed subject to the penalties of perjury but need not be sworn to before a notary public and shall be filed in the circuit court of the circuit wherein the person who is the subject of the petition is in custody. The attorney general, the attorney general&amp;rsquo;s deputy, special deputy, or appointee designated to present the case shall assist the petitioner to state the substance of the petition in plain and simple language. The petition may be accompanied by an affidavit or declaration of the licensed physician or psychologist who has examined the person within five days prior to submission of the petition, unless the person whose treatment is sought has refused to submit to a medical or psychological examination, in which case the fact of refusal shall be alleged in the petition. The affidavit or declaration shall set forth the signs and symptoms relied upon by the physician or psychologist to determine whether the person is in need of treatment, whether the person is capable of realizing and making a rational decision with respect to the person&amp;rsquo;s need for treatment, and the recommended treatment. If the petitioner believes that further evaluation is necessary before treatment, the petitioner may request such further evaluation. (b) If the person has been given an examination, evaluation, or treatment in a psychiatric facility or by the department within five days before the filing of the petition, and treatment is recommended by the staff of the facility or the department, the petition may be accompanied by an affidavit or declaration of the department&amp;rsquo;s medical director or the mental health administrator in lieu of a physician&amp;rsquo;s or psychologist&amp;rsquo;s affidavit or declaration.
