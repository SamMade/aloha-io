Any member whose term has expired and who is not disqualified for membership under this subsection may continue in office as a holdover member until a successor is nominated and appointed; provided that a holdover member shall not hold office beyond the end of the second regular legislative session following the expiration of the member&rsquo;s term of office.</p>

<p>(1) The implementation and operation of the system;</p>

<p>(2) The establishment of performance measures;</p>

<p>(3) Specifications and configuration parameters for the operation of the system;</p>

<p>(4) Management of the system; and</p>

<p>(5) Policies and procedures governing the use of the system, including policies to safeguard the safety, confidentiality, and autonomy of victims.</p>

<p>(f) Meetings of the governance committee shall be held on a quarterly basis during the system&rsquo;s first year of implementation and no less than twice a year thereafter.</p>

<p>(g) The members of the governance committee shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses, including travel expenses, necessary for the performance of their duties.</p>

<p>(h) Members of the governance committee acting in good faith and within the scope of their duties under this chapter shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability arising from these acts, except where the member&rsquo;s conduct would constitute gross negligence, wilful and wanton misconduct, or intentional misconduct.
