The legislature finds and declares that maintaining an inmate&amp;rsquo;s family and community relationships is an effective correctional technique which reduces recidivism. The legislature further finds that enhancing visitor services increases the frequency and quality of visits, thereby discouraging violent prisoner activity; and that the location of prisons and the lack of services to assist visitors presently impedes visiting.
