The discretionary function exception in §662-15(1) is limited to situations in which a government agent is engaged in the effectuation of &amp;ldquo;broad public policy&amp;rdquo;; the investigation of a complaint by the Hawaii civil rights commission, in and of itself, does not involve such considerations; thus, a counterclaim for negligence in the performance of an investigation is not barred by sovereign immunity. 88 H. 85, 962 P.2d 344 (1998).
