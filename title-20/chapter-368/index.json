Law Journals and Reviews Employee Rights Under Judicial Scrutiny: Prevalent Policy Discourse and the Hawaii Supreme Court. 14 UH L. Rev. 189 (1992). Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: Remedies Available to Victims in Hawaii. 15 UH L. Rev. 453 (1993). Case Notes Section 368 [sic], which was quite similar to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), found to be the most &amp;ldquo;analogous&amp;rdquo; state statute regarding applicable limitations period for plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s ADA claim; since statutory period of ninety days was appropriately &amp;ldquo;borrowed&amp;rdquo; and became part of plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s ADA claim, and since plaintiff filed suit within this time period, plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claim was not time-barred under ADA limitations period; passenger ticket contract did not trump applicable state law and ADA limitations periods. 51 F. Supp. 2d 1057 (1999). Plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s [chapters] 368 and 378 state law claims against the county were time-barred under §46-72, where plaintiff never provided the county written notice of plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claim. 504 F. Supp. 2d 969 (2007). Plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s charges filed with the equal employment opportunity commission were deemed &amp;ldquo;dual-filed&amp;rdquo; with the Hawaii civil rights commission. Plaintiff timely filed the charge for claims under chapter 378 based on plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s termination within the 180-day time limitation. 907 F. Supp. 2d 1143 (2012). ",
