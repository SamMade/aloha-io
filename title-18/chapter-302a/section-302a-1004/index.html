These performance indicators shall include but not be limited to:</p>

<p>(8) Establish an explicit link between professional evaluation results and individual accountability through professional development of the knowledge, skill, and professional behavior necessary to the position, by requiring that results of the professional evaluation be used by the department to prescribe professional development focus and content, as appropriate;</p>

<p>(B) The satisfaction of stakeholders affected by the work of the complex area superintendents and principals, which may be measured by broadbased surveys; and</p>

<p>&copy; Fiscal accountability.</p>

<p>(b) The department shall annually post on the department&rsquo;s website information on the specifics of the implementation of the comprehensive accountability system, as well as the fiscal requirements and legislative actions necessary to maintain and improve the accountability system.</p>

<p>(2) Summaries of each school&rsquo;s standards implementation design;</p>

<p>(3) Summary descriptions of the demographic makeup of the schools, with indications of the range of these conditions among schools within Hawaii;</p>

<p>(4) Comparisons of conditions affecting Hawaii&rsquo;s schools with the conditions of schools in other states;</p>

<p>(5) Other such assessments as may be deemed appropriate by the board; and</p>

<p>(6) Any other reports required by this section.</p>

<p>(d) The department shall provide electronic access to computer-based financial management, student information, and other information systems to the legislature and the auditor. The department shall submit to the legislature and to the governor, at least twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, a school-by-school expenditure report that includes but is not limited to the following:</p>

<p>(D) Other commitments, including contingencies, capital improvement projects, out-of-district obligations, and legal obligations; and</p>

<p>(E) Leadership, including school management, program and operations management, and district management; and</p>

<p>(2) The measures of accuracy, efficiency, and productivity of the department, districts, and schools in delivering resources to the classroom and the student.</p>

<p>(e) The superintendent of education is responsible for the development and implementation of an educational accountability system. The system shall include consequences and shall be designed through a collaborative process involving stakeholders that shall include parents, community members, the respective exclusive representatives, as well as others deemed appropriate by the superintendent.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, negotiations under chapter 89 shall be between the superintendent or the superintendent&rsquo;s designee and the respective exclusive representative, and shall be limited to the impact on personnel arising from the superintendent&rsquo;s decision in implementing the educational accountability system. After the initial agreement is negotiated, provisions on the impact of the accountability on personnel may be reopened only upon mutual agreement of the parties.
