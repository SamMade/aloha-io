<p>(6) Any other reports required by this section.</p>

<p>(e) The superintendent of education is responsible for the development and implementation of an educational accountability system. The system shall include consequences and shall be designed through a collaborative process involving stakeholders that shall include parents, community members, the respective exclusive representatives, as well as others deemed appropriate by the superintendent.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, negotiations under chapter 89 shall be between the superintendent or the superintendent&rsquo;s designee and the respective exclusive representative, and shall be limited to the impact on personnel arising from the superintendent&rsquo;s decision in implementing the educational accountability system. After the initial agreement is negotiated, provisions on the impact of the accountability on personnel may be reopened only upon mutual agreement of the parties.
