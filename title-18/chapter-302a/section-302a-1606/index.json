(d) In determining the value per acre for any new residential development, the fee simple value of the land identified for the new or expanded school facility shall be based on the appraised fair market value of improved, vacant land, zoned for residential use, and serviced by roads, utilities, and drainage. An appraiser, licensed pursuant to chapter 466K, who is selected and paid for by the developer, shall determine the value of the land. If the department does not agree with the developer&amp;rsquo;s appraisal, the department may engage another licensed appraiser at its own expense, and resolve, through negotiation between the two appraisers, a fair market value. If neither party agrees, the first two appraisers shall select the third appraiser, with the cost of the third appraisal being shared equally by the department and the developer, and the third appraisal shall be binding on both parties. (e) The developer or owner of new residential developments of fifty or more units shall either pay the fee in lieu based on the land value as determined in subsection (d) or convey appropriate acreage as determined in subsection (b). When conveying the fee simple interest for the new or expanded school facility, the developers shall be credited the difference between the fair market fee simple value of the property and the developers&amp;rsquo; proportionate share of the value of the land as determined in subsection (d) against any construction cost component impact fee. Any excess may be transferred and used as credit against any future land or construction cost requirements on any other development of the State. (f) The dollar amount of the fee in lieu shall be determined using the following formula: Acres of land subject to the fee in lieu, as determined under subsection &amp;copy; multiplied by the value per acre of land determined pursuant to subsection (d).
