  "context": "[ยง302A-1141.4] Use of physical restraint limited; notification; policies and procedures; training; review. (a) The use of physical restraint shall be prohibited in public schools unless a student&amp;rsquo;s behavior poses an imminent danger of property damage or physical injury to the student, school personnel, or others and only for so long as the danger persists; provided that other less intrusive interventions have failed or been determined to be inappropriate for the student. (b) No physical restraint may be imposed that is life threatening, including physical restraint that may restrict breathing. &amp;copy; The board shall establish a policy regarding the use of restraint in public schools. The department shall establish procedures to be followed after each incident involving the imposition of restraint upon a student, including procedures to provide to the parent or legal guardian of the student: (1) An immediate verbal or electronic communication on the same day as each incident; and (2) Written notification within twenty-four hours of each incident. (d) All parents and legal guardians of students shall receive, upon the student&amp;rsquo;s entry into public school, written information issued by the department about policies and procedures for restraint. This written information shall include: (1) A brief summary describing the training received by public school staff in using restraint in facilities or programs; (2) Information describing board policy; (3) Information on the procedures for determining when restraint can and cannot be properly used in public school settings; (4) Definitions of restraint; (5) Information on the procedural safeguards that are in place to protect the rights of children and their parents or legal guardians; (6) A description of the alignment of policies and procedures on restraint with applicable state laws or department rules; (7) Information on the procedures for notifying parents and legal guardians when restraint has been used with their child; and (8) Information on the procedures for notifying parents and legal guardians about any changes to policies and procedures on restraint. (e) The department shall make information relating to policies and procedures available on the department&amp;rsquo;s website. (f) If policy or procedural changes related to restraint are made during the school year, the department shall post the changes on its website immediately. (g) All public schools shall ensure that staff who use restraint in facilities or programs are trained, recertified, or trained and recertified on a periodic basis no less frequently than annually.

(h) No less than annually, there shall be a review of data on students at each public school who were restrained, which shall be conducted as directed by each complex area superintendent. The review shall determine whether: (1) There are strategies in place to address the students with dangerous behaviors at issue; (2) The strategies in place are effective in increasing appropriate behaviors of students with dangerous behaviors; and (3) New strategies need to be developed or current strategies need to be revised or changed to prevent the reoccurrence of dangerous behaviors. Patterns and trends in the data that are identified by the review shall be reported to the department. (i) Each public school shall maintain records of its reviews of restraint data and any resulting decisions or actions regarding the use of restraint. (j) The department shall review policies and procedures on the use of restraint, including by reviewing available data on such use, outcomes, settings, individual staff involvement, and programs, and the frequency of use for student populations categorized by: individual students; groups of students; gender; race; national origin; disability status and type of disability; and limited English proficiency, for the purposes of determining: (1) Whether policies for restraint are being applied consistently; (2) The accuracy and consistency with which restraint data is being collected, as well as the extent to which this data is being used to plan behavioral interventions and staff training; (3) Whether policies and procedures are being implemented with fidelity; (4) Whether policies and procedures continue to protect students; and (5) Whether policies and procedures remain properly aligned with applicable state statutes and administrative rules and consistent with privacy laws.
