  "context": "[§302A-609] Causes for discharge or demotion; preferred eligibility list. Causes for the discharge or demotion of a teacher shall be inefficiency or immorality; wilful violations of policies and rules of the department; or for other good and just cause. The department, without a hearing, may terminate the tenure rights of a teacher who fails to return to service, except when caused by illness, following the expiration of an approved leave of absence. Teachers may also be dismissed because of a decrease in the number of pupils or for other causes over which the department has no control. Dismissals due to a decrease in the number of pupils or for causes over which the department has no control shall begin with those teachers with the least number of years of service. The teachers so dismissed shall be placed on a preferred eligibility list and shall have the right to be restored to duty in the order of length of service whenever vacancies occur in which the teacher is qualified. [L 1996, c 89, pt of §2] Attorney General Opinions Bargained for random drug testing program for public school teachers with appropriate procedural protections is constitutional and would not violate either the federal or state Constitution. If a court were to find such a program to violate either the federal or state Constitution, the doctrine of qualified immunity would bar personal liability for any state official; if a court were to impose personal liability, based upon past history and practice, the legislature would fund payment of the claims. Att. Gen. Op. 08-1. "
