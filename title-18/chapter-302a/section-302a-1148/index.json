(a) All public school buildings, facilities, and grounds shall be available for general recreational purposes, and for public and community use, whenever these activities do not interfere with the normal and usual activities of the school and its pupils. Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the department shall adopt rules under chapter 91 as are deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of this section and may issue licenses, revocable permits, concessions, or rights of entry to school buildings and grounds for such periods of use as deemed appropriate by the department. All such dispositions, including those in excess of fourteen days, need not be approved by the board of land and natural resources; provided that approval by the board of land and natural resources shall be required when the dispositions are for periods in excess of a year. The department may assess and collect fees and charges from the users of school buildings, facilities, grounds, and equipment, which include fees and charges assessed and collected by the department for parking on roadways and in parking areas under the jurisdiction of the department, pursuant to section 302A-1151.6. The fees and charges shall be deposited into a separate fund and expended by the department under rules as may be adopted by the board; provided that any parking fees assessed and collected by a school shall be deposited to the credit of that school&amp;rsquo;s nonappropriated local school fund account. (b) A separate subaccount of the fund established pursuant to subsection (a), to be known as the school facilities subaccount, shall be established for all proceeds from the leases, permits, interest income generated from public school lands, and other revenue generated from the nonpermanent disposition of public school lands, including facilities, pursuant to section 302A-1151.1. The subaccount shall be governed by section 302A-1151.2. [L 1996, c 89, pt of §2; am L 2010, c 190, §3; am L 2013, c 155, §3] Cross References After-school and weekend programs, see §302A-408. "
