<p>(b) If, in accordance with chapter 92, the board determines, on a case-by-case basis, that extenuating circumstances exist to justify the suspension, the board may temporarily suspend its rules, or any portion thereof. The board shall establish, in accordance with chapter 91, procedures for the suspension of its rules. When determining whether to suspend its rules, the board shall also establish the length of time for which the suspension shall be in effect.</p>

<p>(1) Adopting, amending, or repealing rules;</p>

<p>(2) Ordering disciplinary action against a licensee, including license revocation or suspension, or the imposition of conditions or fines; provided that summary suspensions may be delegated; or</p>

<p>(3) Granting or denying permits or licenses, including license renewals and reinstatements, or otherwise conditioning permits or licenses, unless the granting, denying, or otherwise conditioning of a permit or license does not require the exercise of the board&rsquo;s expertise and discretion.</p>

The board shall conduct its meetings to delegate powers and duties to its executive director, or other designee, in accordance with chapters 91 and 92.
