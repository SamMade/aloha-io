The department shall provide students at charter schools, including students enrolled at charter schools whose curriculum incorporates virtual education, with the same opportunity to participate in athletics as is provided to students at department schools.

All charter school students participating in athletics shall abide by all rules, regulations, and policies of the athletic league, association, and program applicable to the department school in whose athletic program the student is participating.
