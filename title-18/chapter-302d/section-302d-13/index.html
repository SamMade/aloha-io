<p>(A) This vote shall be considered by the authorizer to be the primary indication of the existing administrative, support, and teaching personnel, and parents&rsquo; approval to convert to a charter school;</p>

<p>(B) The balance of stakeholders represented in the vote and the extent of support received in support of the conversion shall be key factors, along with the applicant&rsquo;s proposed plans, to be considered by the authorizer when deciding whether to award a charter; and</p>

<p>&copy; A breakdown of the number of administrative, support, and teaching personnel, and parents of students who constitute the existing department school and the number who actually participated in the vote shall be provided to the authorizer;</p>
