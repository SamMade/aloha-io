The surety bond shall be executed by the private college or university as the principal by a surety company authorized to do business in the State and shall run concurrently with the authorization period and any period of reauthorization, unless terminated or canceled by the surety company. (e) The surety bond under subsection (d) shall be conditioned to provide indemnification to any student or enrollee, or to any parent or legal guardian of a student or enrollee, whom the director finds to have suffered a loss of tuition or fees as a result of any act or practice that is a violation of this chapter and to provide alternative enrollment as provided in section 305J-15 for students enrolled in a private college or university that ceases operation.

The release shall not discharge or otherwise affect a claim filed by a student or enrollee or the student or enrollee&amp;rsquo;s parent or legal guardian pursuant to section 305J-15 for a loss of tuition or fees that occurred while the surety bond was in effect or that occurred under any note or contract executed during any period of time when the surety bond was in effect, except when another surety bond is filed in a like amount and provides indemnification for any such loss.
