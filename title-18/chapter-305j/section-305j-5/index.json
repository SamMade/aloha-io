In addition, the department may serve as the state agency for the receipt of federal funds when federal legislation dealing with higher education or post-secondary education requires, as a condition of the receipt of federal funds, the designation of a state agency that is broadly representative of the general public and of post-secondary education in the State and when agencies other than the department may not qualify. &amp;copy; No funds appropriated by the legislature may be used to aid a person attending an institution not owned or exclusively controlled by the State or a department of the State or to pay for any staff work distributing federal or private funds to students attending such schools. The maximum amount of any grant awarded under the Hawaii state incentive grant program shall be equal to the maximum allowed by federal law. (d) The department, when appropriate and necessary, may be assisted by other state agencies, including but not limited to the University of Hawaii system and the department of education. (e) The director, acting through the department of the attorney general, may proceed by injunction against any violation of this chapter, but an injunction proceeding or an order issued therein or as a result thereof shall not bar the imposition of any other penalty for a violation of this chapter.
