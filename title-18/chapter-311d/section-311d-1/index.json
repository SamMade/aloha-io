The receiving state school may allow the student to attend similar educational courses within the school district if the receiving state school does not offer such educational courses.

This paragraph shall not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student. (d) Placement flexibility. Appropriate education agency administrative officials shall have flexibility in waiving a course or program prerequisite, or other precondition for placement in courses or programs offered under the jurisdiction of the appropriate education agency. (e) Absence as related to deployment activities. A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined by the compact, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences at the discretion of the appropriate education agency superintendent to visit with the student&amp;rsquo;s parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.

ARTICLE VII GRADUATION To facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, state and appropriate education agencies shall incorporate the following procedures: (1) Waiver requirements. Appropriate education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily completed in another appropriate education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial. If a waiver is not granted to a student who would qualify to graduate from the sending school, the appropriate education agency shall provide an alternative means of acquiring required coursework so that graduation may occur on time. This section shall not obligate the school or appropriate education agency to pay for an online course if funding is unavailable; (2) Exit exams. For students entering high school in the eleventh or twelfth grade, states shall accept: (A) Exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state; (B) National norm-referenced achievement tests; or &amp;copy; Alternative testing, in lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state. If subparagraphs (A), (B), and &amp;copy; cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a student transferring in the student&amp;rsquo;s senior year, then paragraph (3) shall apply; and (3) Transfers during senior year. If a military student transferring at the beginning or during the senior year is ineligible to graduate from the receiving appropriate education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving appropriate education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending appropriate education agency, if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending appropriate education agency. If one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this article. This paragraph permits but shall not require a sending state to deny a diploma to a student transferring to a receiving state with an exit exam requirement if the student does not meet the graduation requirements of the appropriate education agency of the sending state. ARTICLE VIII STATE COORDINATION (a) Each member state, through the creation of a state council or use of an existing body or board, shall provide for the coordination among its agencies of government, appropriate education agencies, and military installations concerning the state&amp;rsquo;s participation in, and compliance with, this compact and interstate commission activities.

A member state that does not have a school district deemed to contain a high concentration of military children may appoint a superintendent from another school district to represent appropriate education agencies on the state council. (b) The state council of each member state shall appoint or designate a military family education liaison to assist military families and the state in facilitating the implementation of this compact. &amp;copy; The compact commissioner responsible for the administration and management of the state&amp;rsquo;s participation in the compact shall be recommended by the superintendent of education with the approval of the board of education.

(b) The interstate commission, by a majority of the members, shall elect annually from among its members a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson&amp;rsquo;s absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the interstate commission. The officers elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the interstate commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for ordinary and necessary costs incurred by them in the performance of their responsibilities as officers of the interstate commission. &amp;copy; The executive committee shall have such authority and duties as may be set forth in the bylaws, including: (1) Managing the affairs of the interstate commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and purposes of the interstate commission; (2) Overseeing an organizational structure within, and appropriate procedures for, the interstate commission to provide for the creation of rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support functions; and (3) Planning, implementing, and coordinating communications and activities with other state, federal, and local government organizations to advance the goals of the interstate commission. (d) The executive committee, subject to the approval of the interstate commission, may appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation, as the interstate commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the interstate commission, but shall not be a member of the interstate commission. The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate commission. (e) The interstate commission&amp;rsquo;s executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of such person: (l) The liability of the interstate commission&amp;rsquo;s executive director and employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person&amp;rsquo;s employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within the person&amp;rsquo;s state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of such person; (2) The interstate commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person; and (3) To the extent not covered by the state involved, a member state, the interstate commission, or the representatives or employees of the interstate commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.

ARTICLE XII RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION (a) The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, then the action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. (b) Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission. &amp;copy; Not later than thirty days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission&amp;rsquo;s authority. (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state. ARTICLE XIII OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION (a) Oversight: (1) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact&amp;rsquo;s purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules adopted hereunder shall have the force and effect of law; (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission; and (3) The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. (b) Default, technical assistance, suspension, and termination. If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall: (1) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and (2) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. &amp;copy; If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default. (d) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state&amp;rsquo;s legislature, and each of the member states. (e) The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination. (f) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state. (g) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its [principal] offices.
