(a) There is established within the University of Hawaii the robotics and problem-based, applied learning program, which shall be administered by the University of Hawaii college of engineering. The mission of the robotics and problem-based, applied learning program shall be to develop science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills among students in the fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy program through robotics- and problem-based, applied learning projects and competitions. The robotics and problem-based, applied learning program shall work with existing programs to expand and strengthen activities, including but not limited to National Aeronautics and Space Administration explorer schools; fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology robotics, lego league, and vex challenges or competitions; botball educational robotics programs; and underwater robotics challenges. (b) The robotics and problem-based, applied learning program shall coordinate and cooperate with the fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy program in establishing an integrated system of science, technology, engineering, and math-related, problem-based, applied learning programs under the administration of the pre-academy program. The robotics and problem-based, applied learning program shall enlist, encourage, train, and support volunteer teachers and other mentors to conduct robotics and space-related programs at the school level.
