(a) The board, without further authorization or approval of the legislature, but with the approval of the governor, may provide for the issuance of revenue bonds (herein referred to as refunding bonds) for the purpose of refunding, redeeming, or retiring at or at any time before maturity or at any time before the first date upon which the outstanding revenue bonds to be refunded may be called for redemption, any revenue bonds issued under this subpart, including any revenue bonds that the holders may consent to be paid or refunded even though the revenue bonds are not matured or are not callable or redeemable, and for the purpose of funding indebtedness not evidenced by revenue bonds but that was incurred for purposes for which revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to this subpart. The rate of interest borne by the refunding bonds shall not be affected or limited by the rate of interest borne by the revenue bonds to be refunded or the indebtedness to be funded. All provisions of this subpart applicable to the issuance of revenue bonds shall be complied with in the issuance of refunding bonds. Refunding bonds shall be sold as provided in section 304A-2674, or the board may provide for the exchange of refunding bonds for a like principal amount of outstanding revenue bonds for the refunding of which the issuance of the refunding bonds has been authorized, whether or not the interest rate on the refunding bonds is higher than the interest rate on the bonds refunded. (b) Refunding bonds may be issued in a principal amount sufficient to provide funds for the payment of all revenue bonds or indebtedness to be funded or refunded, and for the payment of all expenses paid or incurred in connection with the calling, redeeming, retiring, or paying of indebtedness or outstanding revenue bonds, and the issuance of refunding bonds. The expenses may include the amount necessary for the payment of interest upon the indebtedness to be funded or the revenue bonds to be refunded to the maturity or redemption date thereof, the amount necessary for the payment of interest upon the refunding bonds from the date of delivery thereof to the date upon which the principal of the outstanding revenue bonds to be refunded will be paid whether at maturity or pursuant to a call for redemption thereof, or pursuant to agreement with the holders thereof, plus in any case the amount of any premium required to be paid to call or retire the revenue bonds.
