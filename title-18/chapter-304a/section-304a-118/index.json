(b) In developing the graduation pathway system, the university shall include elements such as structured, default pathways to graduation; academic maps with sequential scheduling of classes; intrusive advising; data on the dynamics of the local employment market, including the availability of employment; and other elements as appropriate to provide guidance to students toward timely graduation.
