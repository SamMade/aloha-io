(a) There is established within the University of Hawaii, the fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy program, which shall be administered by the University of Hawaii college of engineering. The mission of the fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy program shall be, with respect to middle schools, to provide additional resources and expertise for the department of education to stimulate the interest and achievement of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills. To achieve its mission, the fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy program shall house and provide direction for the robotics and problem-based, applied learning program under section 304A-1862 and the research experiences for teachers program under section 304A-1863. (b) The goals of the pre-academy program shall be to: (1) Serve students between fourth and eighth grades, with problem-based, applied learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related skills in a manner that complements the academic program at public high schools; and (2) Motivate and engage students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. &amp;copy; The pre-academy program shall encourage partnerships with other relevant programs within the University of Hawaii system, department of education, project EAST (environmental and spatial technology) program, and appropriate public and private agencies, to establish a program of problem-based, applied learning for elementary and middle school students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. School participation in the fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy programs shall be voluntary. (d) The fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy program shall support development of additional problem-based, applied learning projects and summer science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs for middle school teachers. For additional problem-based, applied learning projects, priority shall be determined in collaboration with participating teachers. Areas may include global positioning system technology, ocean science, astronomy, earth science and wireless communications technology, conservation biology, and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills-stimulating subjects as appropriate. (e) The fostering inspiration and relevance through science and technology pre-academy program shall develop program evaluation measures to ensure that all programs conducted under the pre-academy program are contributing to the advancement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics academics in the elementary and middle schools through research.
