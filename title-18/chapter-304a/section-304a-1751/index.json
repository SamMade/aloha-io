  "context": "K. Special Medical Residency Program Cross References Hawaii health corps, see chapter 309H. [ยง304A-1751] Findings and purpose. The legislature finds that the limited supply of physicians and the attractiveness of private practice inhibit the efforts of the department of health to provide primary medical care in certain rural communities of the State and lessen the ability of the department of public safety to recruit physicians to serve in correctional facilities. The legislature further finds that an opportunity should be made available to attract physicians to fill positions in the department of health and the department of public safety. The purpose of this subpart is to establish an innovative program that seeks to provide an opportunity for physicians to serve with the State and, consequently, ease the difficulty of the department of health and the department of public safety in recruiting physicians. This subpart does not change the standards of any medical residency program or affect the existing relationship between the school of medicine of the University of Hawaii and the various hospitals that take part in any residency program. [L 2006, c 75, pt of ยง2] "
