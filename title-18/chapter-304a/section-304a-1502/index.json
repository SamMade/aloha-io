The staff of the geophysics and planetology institute shall include a specialist qualified in geology and a specialist qualified in volcanology, or a specialist qualified in both fields (to be designated as state geologist and state volcanologist or state geologist and volcanologist, as appropriate), whose duties shall include consultation with state officials, departments, and agencies concerning possible applications of these fields and research desirable to facilitate such applications.
