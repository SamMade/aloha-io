PAYMENT §490:4A-401 Payment date. &amp;ldquo;Payment date&amp;rdquo; of a payment order means the day on which the amount of the order is payable to the beneficiary by the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank. The payment date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received by the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received by the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank. [L 1991, c 41, pt of §1]f an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor benefited from the proceeds of the item. &amp;copy; A bank may charge against the account of a customer a check that is otherwise properly payable from the account, even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless the customer has given notice to the bank of the postdating describing the check with reasonable certainty. The notice will be effective for the period stated in section 490:4-403(b) for stop-payment orders, and must be received at such time and in such manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with respect to the check described in section 490:4-303. If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its act. The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 490:4-402. (d) A bank that in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer according to: (1) The original terms of the altered item; or (2) The terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed unless the bank has notice that the completion was improper.
