<p>(1) Would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or</p>

<p>(2) Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.</p>

<p>(b) Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under section 490:9-610 or an acceptance of collateral under section 490:9-620.</p>
