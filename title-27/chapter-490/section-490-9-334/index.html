      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Priority of security interests in fixtures and crops</h2>
      <p><strong>ยง490:9-334 Priority of security interests in fixtures and crops.</strong> (a) A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</p>

<p>(b) This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.</p>

<p>&copy; In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.</p>

<p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:</p>

<p>(1) The security interest is a purchase-money security interest;</p>

<p>(2) The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and</p>

<p>(3) The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days thereafter.</p>

<p>(e) A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</p>

<p>(1) The debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:</p>

<p>(A) Is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and</p>

<p>(B) Has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;</p>

<p>(2) Before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable:</p>

<p>(A) Factory or office machines;</p>

<p>(B) Equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or</p>

<p>&copy; Replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;</p>

<p>(3) The conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article; or</p>

<p>(4) The security interest is:</p>

<p>(A) Created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction; and</p>

<p>(B) Perfected pursuant to a statute described in section 490:9-311(a)(2).</p>

<p>(f) A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</p>

<p>(1) The encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or</p>

<p>(2) The debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.</p>

<p>(g) The priority of the security interest under subsection (f) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor&rsquo;s right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.</p>

<p>(h) A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.</p>

<p>(i) A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property. [L 2000, c 241, pt of ยง1]</p>
