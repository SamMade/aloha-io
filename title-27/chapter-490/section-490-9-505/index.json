(a) A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in section 490:9-311(a), using the terms &amp;ldquo;consignor&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;consignee&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;lessor&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;lessee&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bailor&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bailee&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;licensor&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;licensee&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;owner&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;registered owner&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;buyer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;seller&amp;rdquo;, or words of similar import, instead of the terms &amp;ldquo;secured party&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;debtor&amp;rdquo;. (b) This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under section 490:9-311(b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.
