  "context": "ยง490:2-325 &amp;ldquo;Letter of credit&amp;rdquo; term; &amp;ldquo;confirmed credit&amp;rdquo;. (1) Failure of the buyer seasonably to furnish an agreed letter of credit is a breach of the contract for sale. (2) The delivery to seller of a proper letter of credit suspends the buyer&amp;rsquo;s obligation to pay. If the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller may on seasonable notification to the buyer require payment directly from him. (3) Unless otherwise agreed the term &amp;ldquo;letter of credit&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;banker&amp;rsquo;s credit&amp;rdquo; in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term &amp;ldquo;confirmed credit&amp;rdquo; means that the credit must also carry the direct obligation of such an agency which does business in the seller&amp;rsquo;s financial market.
