  "context": "§490:9-615 Application of proceeds of disposition; liability for deficiency and right to surplus. (a) A secured party shall apply or pay over for application the cash proceeds of disposition under section 490:9-610 in the following order to: (1) The reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and disposing, and, to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party; (2) The satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made; (3) The satisfaction of obligations secured by any subordinate security interest in or other subordinate lien on the collateral if: (A) The secured party receives from the holder of the subordinate security interest or other lien an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed; and (B) In a case in which a consignor has an interest in the collateral, the subordinate security interest or other lien is senior to the interest of the consignor; and (4) A secured party that is a consignor of the collateral if the secured party receives from the consignor an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed. (b) If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest or lien within a reasonable time. Unless the holder does so, the secured party need not comply with the holder&amp;rsquo;s demand under subsection (a)(3). &amp;copy; A secured party need not apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds of disposition under section 490:9-610 unless the failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable. A secured party that applies or pays over for application noncash proceeds shall do so in a commercially reasonable manner. (d) If the security interest under which a disposition is made secures payment or performance of an obligation, after making the payments and applications required by subsection (a) and permitted by subsection &amp;copy;: (1) Unless subsection (a)(4) requires the secured party to apply or pay over cash proceeds to a consignor, the secured party shall account to and pay a debtor for any surplus; and (2) The obligor is liable for any deficiency. (e) If the underlying transaction is a sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes: (1) The debtor is not entitled to any surplus; and (2) The obligor is not liable for any deficiency. (f) The surplus or deficiency following a disposition is calculated based on the amount of proceeds that would have been realized in a disposition complying with this part to a transferee other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor if: (1) The transferee in the disposition is the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor; and (2) The amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of proceeds that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought. (g) A secured party that receives cash proceeds of a disposition in good faith and without knowledge that the receipt violates the rights of the holder of a security interest or other lien that is not subordinate to the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made: (1) Takes the cash proceeds free of the security interest or other lien; (2) Is not obligated to apply the proceeds of the disposition to the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or other lien; and (3) Is not obligated to account to or pay the holder of the security interest or other lien for any surplus.
