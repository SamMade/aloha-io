(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections &amp;copy;, (d), and (e), a description of personal or real property is sufficient, whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), a description of collateral reasonably identifies the collateral if it identifies the collateral by: (1) Specific listing; (2) Category; (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a type of collateral defined in this chapter; (4) Quantity; (5) Computational or allocational formula or procedure; or (6) Except as otherwise provided in subsection &amp;copy;, any other method, if the identity of the collateral is objectively determinable. &amp;copy; A description of collateral as &amp;ldquo;all the debtor&amp;rsquo;s assets&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;all the debtor&amp;rsquo;s personal property&amp;rdquo; or using words of similar import does not reasonably identify the collateral. (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a description of a security entitlement, securities account, or commodity account is sufficient if it describes: (1) The collateral by those terms or as investment property; or (2) The underlying financial asset or commodity contract. (e) A description only by type of collateral defined in this chapter is an insufficient description of: (1) A commercial tort claim; or (2) In a consumer transaction, consumer goods, a security entitlement, a securities account, or a commodity account.
