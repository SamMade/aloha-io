      <p><strong>ยง490:9-324 Priority of purchase-money security interests.</strong> (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same goods, and, except as otherwise provided in section 490:9-327, a perfected security interest in its identifiable proceeds also has priority, if the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the collateral or within twenty days thereafter.</p>

<p>(b) Subject to subsection &copy; and except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in inventory has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same inventory, has priority over a conflicting security interest in chattel paper or an instrument constituting proceeds of the inventory and in proceeds of the chattel paper, if so provided in section 490:9-330, and, except as otherwise provided in section 490:9-327, also has priority in identifiable cash proceeds of the inventory to the extent the identifiable cash proceeds are received on or before the delivery of the inventory to a buyer, if:</p>

<p>(1) The purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the inventory;</p>

<p>(2) The purchase-money secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting security interest;</p>

<p>(3) The holder of the conflicting security interest receives the notification within five years before the debtor receives possession of the inventory; and</p>

<p>(4) The notification states that the person sending the notification has or expects to acquire a purchase-money security interest in inventory of the debtor and describes the inventory.</p>

<p>&copy; Subsection (b)(2) through (4) applies only if the holder of the conflicting security interest had filed a financing statement covering the same types of inventory:</p>

<p>(1) If the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing; or</p>

<p>(2) If the purchase-money security interest is temporarily perfected without filing or possession under section 490:9-312(f), before the beginning of the twenty-day period thereunder.</p>

<p>(d) Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in livestock that are farm products has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same livestock, and, except as otherwise provided in section 490:9-327, a perfected security interest in their identifiable proceeds and identifiable products in their unmanufactured states also has priority, if:</p>

<p>(1) The purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the livestock;</p>

<p>(2) The purchase-money secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting security interest;</p>

<p>(3) The holder of the conflicting security interest receives the notification within six months before the debtor receives possession of the livestock; and</p>

<p>(4) The notification states that the person sending the notification has or expects to acquire a purchase-money security interest in livestock of the debtor and describes the livestock.</p>

<p>(e) Subsection (d)(2) through (4) applies only if the holder of the conflicting security interest had filed a financing statement covering the same types of livestock:</p>

<p>(1) If the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing; or</p>

<p>(2) If the purchase-money security interest is temporarily perfected without filing or possession under section 490:9-312(f), before the beginning of the twenty-day period thereunder.</p>

<p>(f) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in software has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same collateral, and, except as otherwise provided in section 490:9-327, a perfected security interest in its identifiable proceeds also has priority, to the extent that the purchase-money security interest in the goods in which the software was acquired for use has priority in the goods and proceeds of the goods under this section.</p>

<p>(g) If more than one security interest qualifies for priority in the same collateral under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (f):</p>

<p>(1) A security interest securing an obligation incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral has priority over a security interest securing an obligation incurred for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of collateral; and</p>

<p>(2) In all other cases, section 490:9-322(a) applies to the qualifying security interests. [L 2000, c 241, pt of ยง1]</p>
