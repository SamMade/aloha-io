  "context": "ยง490:3-205 Special indorsement; blank indorsement; anomalous indorsement. (a) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a &amp;ldquo;special indorsement&amp;rdquo;. When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person. The principles stated in section 490:3-110 apply to special indorsements. (b) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a &amp;ldquo;blank indorsement&amp;rdquo;. When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed. &amp;copy; The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable. (d) &amp;ldquo;Anomalous indorsement&amp;rdquo; means an indorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument. An anomalous indorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may be negotiated. [L 1991, c 118, pt of ยง1] "
