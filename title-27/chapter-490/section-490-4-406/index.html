      <p><strong>ยง490:4A-406 Payment by originator to beneficiary; discharge of underlying obligation.</strong> (a) Subject to sections 490:4A-211(e), 490:4A-405(d), and 490:4A-405(e), the originator of a funds transfer pays the beneficiary of the originator&rsquo;s payment order (i) at the time a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary is accepted by the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank in the funds transfer and (ii) in an amount equal to the amount of the order accepted by the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank, but not more than the amount of the originator&rsquo;s order.</p>

<p>(b) If payment under subsection (a) is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless (i) the payment under subsection (a) was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, (ii) the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary&rsquo;s refusal of the payment, (iii) funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary, and (iv) the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract. If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank under section 490:4A-404(a).</p>

<p>&copy; For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under subsection (b), if the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator&rsquo;s payment order less charges of one or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator&rsquo;s order unless upon demand by the beneficiary, the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges.</p>

<p>(d) Rights of the originator or of the beneficiary of a funds transfer under this section may be varied only by agreement of the originator and the beneficiary. [L 1991, c 41, pt of ยง1]onable period of time, not exceeding thirty days, in which to examine the item or statement of account and notify the bank.</p>

<p>(e) If subsection (d) applies and the customer proves that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, the loss is allocated between the customer precluded and the bank asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of the customer to comply with subsection &copy; and the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. If the customer proves that the bank did not pay the item in good faith, the preclusion under subsection (d) does not apply.</p>

<p>(f) Without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not within one year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subsection (a)) discover and report the customer&rsquo;s unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration. If there is a preclusion under this subsection, the payor bank may not recover for breach of warranty under section 490:4-208 with respect to the unauthorized signature or alteration to which the preclusion applies.
