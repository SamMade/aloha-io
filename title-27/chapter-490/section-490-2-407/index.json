(a) In the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease the lessee&amp;rsquo;s promises under the lease contract become irrevocable and independent upon the lessee&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of the goods. (b) A promise that has become irrevocable and independent under subsection (a): (1) Is effective and enforceable between the parties, and by or against third parties including assignees of the parties; and (2) Is not subject to cancellation, termination, modification, repudiation, excuse, or substitution without the consent of the party to whom the promise runs. &amp;copy; This section does not affect the validity under any other law of a covenant in any lease contract making the lessee&amp;rsquo;s promises irrevocable and independent upon the lessee&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of the goods. [L 1991, c 40, pt of ยง1] Case Notes Acceptance of goods is a requirement for this section to apply; as plaintiff did not accept the photo processing machine, this section did not apply; plaintiff thus did not owe rental payments for the machine under this section. 104 H. 148 (App.), 85 P.3d 1099.
