(a) An issuer may require the following assurance that each necessary indorsement or each instruction is genuine and authorized: (1) In all cases, a guaranty of the signature of the person making an indorsement or originating an instruction including, in the case of an instruction, reasonable assurance of identity; (2) If the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by an agent, appropriate assurance of actual authority to sign; (3) If the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by a fiduciary pursuant to section 490:8-107(a)(4) or (5), appropriate evidence of appointment or incumbency; (4) If there is more than one fiduciary, reasonable assurance that all who are required to sign have done so; and (5) If the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by a person not covered by another provision of this subsection, assurance appropriate to the case corresponding as nearly as may be to the provisions of this subsection.
