(a) Until the repudiating party&amp;rsquo;s next performance is due, the repudiating party can retract the repudiation unless, since the repudiation, the aggrieved party has canceled the lease contract or materially changed the aggrieved party&amp;rsquo;s position or otherwise indicated that the aggrieved party considers the repudiation final. (b) Retraction may be by any method that clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform under the lease contract and includes any assurance demanded under section 490:2A-401. &amp;copy; Retraction reinstates a repudiating party&amp;rsquo;s rights under a lease contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation. [L 1991, c 40, pt of §1]Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business. (3) &amp;ldquo;Entrusting&amp;rdquo; includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor&amp;rsquo;s disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law. (4) The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the articles on secured transactions (article 9) and documents of title (article 7).
