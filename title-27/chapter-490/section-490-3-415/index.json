(a) Subject to subsections (b), &amp;copy;, and (d) and to section 490:3-419(d), if an instrument is dishonored, an indorser is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument (i) according to the terms of the instrument at the time it was indorsed, or (ii) if the indorser indorsed an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 490:3-115 and 490:3-407.
