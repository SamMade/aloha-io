(1) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer: (a) After a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or (b) Fails to make an effective rejection (subsection (1) of section 490:2-602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or &amp;copy; Does any act inconsistent with the seller&amp;rsquo;s ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him. (2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit. [L 1965, c 208, ยง2-606; HRS ยง490:2-606] "
