  "context": "PART 4. PERFORMANCE OF LEASE CONTRACT: REPUDIATED, SUBSTITUTED, AND EXCUSED §490:2A-401 Insecurity: adequate assurance of performance. (a) A lease contract imposes an obligation on each party that the other&amp;rsquo;s expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. (b) If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assurance of due performance. Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable the insecure party may suspend any performance for which the insecure party has not already received the agreed return. &amp;copy; A repudiation of the lease contract occurs if assurance of due performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is not provided to the insecure party within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days after receipt of a demand by the other party. (d) Between merchants, the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered must be determined according to commercial standards. (e) Acceptance of any nonconforming delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party&amp;rsquo;s right to demand adequate assurance of future performance. [L 1991, c 40, pt of §1] which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading: (a) If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but (b) If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there. (3) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, where delivery is to be made without moving the goods: (a) If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where the seller delivers such documents, and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or (b) If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting. (4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a &amp;ldquo;sale&amp;rdquo;. [L 1965, c 208, §2-401; HRS §490:2-401; am L 2004, c 163, §8] "
