(1) Unless otherwise agreed a term for delivery of goods &amp;ldquo;ex-ship&amp;rdquo; (which means from the carrying vessel) or in equivalent language is not restricted to a particular ship and requires delivery from a ship which has reached a place at the named port of destination where goods of the kind are usually discharged. (2) Under such a term unless otherwise agreed: (a) The seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; and (b) The risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship&amp;rsquo;s tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded.
