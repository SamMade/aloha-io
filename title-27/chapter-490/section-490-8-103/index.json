  "context": "ยง490:8-103 Rules for determining whether certain obligations and interests are securities or financial assets. (a) A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock company, or similar entity is a security. (b) An &amp;ldquo;investment company security&amp;rdquo; is a security. &amp;ldquo;Investment company security&amp;rdquo; means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered. Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company. &amp;copy; An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this article, or it is an investment company security. However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account. (d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this article and not by article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that article. However, a negotiable instrument governed by article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account. (e) An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset. (f) A commodity contract, as defined in section 490:9-102(a), is not a security or a financial asset. [L 1997, c 33, pt of ยง2; am L 2000, c 241, ยง22] "
