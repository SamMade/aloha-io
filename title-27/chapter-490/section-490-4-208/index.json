  "context": "§490:4A-208 Misdescription of intermediary bank or beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank. (a) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank only by an identifying number. (1) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank. (2) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order. (b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons. (1) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender&amp;rsquo;s order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order. (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by paragraph (b)(1), as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates. (3) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender&amp;rsquo;s order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person. (4) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender&amp;rsquo;s payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in section 490:4A-302(a)(1). [L 1991, c 41, pt of §1] and loss of interest resulting from the breach. (e) The warranties stated in subsections (a) and (d) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim. (f) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach. (g) A demand check is a check, as provided in section 490:3-104(f). [L 1991, c 118, pt of §4; am L 1998, c 241, §6] Note This section is new. Former §490:4-208 renumbered as §490:4-210. "
