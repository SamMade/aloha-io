(a) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 490:2A-523(a) or 490:2A-523&amp;copy;(1) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor may: (1) Identify to the lease contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time the lessor learned of the default they were in the lessor&amp;rsquo;s or the supplier&amp;rsquo;s possession or control; and (2) Dispose of goods (section 490:2A-527(a)) that demonstrably have been intended for the particular lease contract even though those goods are unfinished.
