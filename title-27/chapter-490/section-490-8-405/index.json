(a) If an owner of a certificated security, whether in registered or bearer form, claims that the certificate has been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken, the issuer shall issue a new certificate if the owner: (1) So requests before the issuer has notice that the certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser; (2) Files with the issuer a sufficient indemnity bond; and (3) Satisfies other reasonable requirements imposed by the issuer. (b) If, after the issue of a new security certificate, a protected purchaser of the original certificate presents it for registration of transfer, the issuer shall register the transfer unless an overissue would result. In that case, the issuer&amp;rsquo;s liability is governed by section 490:8-210. In addition to any rights on the indemnity bond, an issuer may recover the new certificate from a person to whom it was issued or any person taking under that person, except a protected purchaser.
