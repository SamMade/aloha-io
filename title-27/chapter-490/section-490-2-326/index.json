(1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is: (a) A &amp;ldquo;sale on approval&amp;rdquo; if the goods are delivered primarily for use; and (b) A &amp;ldquo;sale or return&amp;rdquo; if the goods are delivered primarily for resale. (2) Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer&amp;rsquo;s creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer&amp;rsquo;s possession. (3) Any &amp;ldquo;or return&amp;rdquo; term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this article (section 490:2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 490:2-202).
