      <p><strong>PART 2. GENERAL DEFINITIONS AND</strong></p>

<p><strong>PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>ยง490:1-201 General definitions.</strong> (a) Unless the context otherwise requires, words or phrases defined in this section, or in the additional definitions contained in other articles of this chapter that apply to particular articles or parts thereof, have the meanings stated.</p>

<p>(b) Subject to definitions contained in other articles of this chapter that apply to particular articles or parts thereof:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aggrieved party&rdquo; means a party entitled to pursue a remedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;, as distinguished from &ldquo;contract&rdquo;, means the bargain of the parties in fact, as found in their language or inferred from other circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade as provided in section 490:1-303.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buyer in ordinary course of business&rdquo; means a person that buys goods in good faith, without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods, and in the ordinary course from a person, other than a pawnbroker, in the business of selling goods of that kind. A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person comports with the usual or customary practices in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller&rsquo;s own usual or customary practices. A person that sells oil, gas, or other minerals at the wellhead or minehead is a person in the business of selling goods of that kind. A buyer in ordinary course of business may buy for cash, by exchange of other property, or on secured or unsecured credit, and may acquire goods or documents of title under a preexisting contract for sale. Only a buyer that takes possession of the goods or has a right to recover the goods from the seller under article 2 may be a buyer in ordinary course of business. &ldquo;Buyer in the ordinary course of business&rdquo; does not include a person that acquires goods in a transfer in bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conspicuous&rdquo;, with reference to a term, means so written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it.

<p>&ldquo;Consumer&rdquo; means an individual who enters into a transaction primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contract&rdquo;, as distinguished from &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;, means the total legal obligation that results from the parties&rsquo; agreement as determined by this chapter and as supplemented by any other applicable law.</p>

<p>(2) Goods that by agreement are treated as equivalent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genuine&rdquo; means free of forgery or counterfeiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good faith&rdquo; means honesty in fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holder&rdquo; means:</p>
