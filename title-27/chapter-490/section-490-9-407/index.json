(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a lease agreement is ineffective to the extent that it: (1) Prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a party to the lease to the assignment or transfer of, [or] the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor&amp;rsquo;s residual interest in the goods; or (2) Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the lease. (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 490:2A-303(g), a term described in subsection (a)(2) is effective to the extent that there is: (1) A transfer by the lessee of the lessee&amp;rsquo;s right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the term; or (2) A delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term. &amp;copy; The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor&amp;rsquo;s interest under the lease contract or the lessor&amp;rsquo;s residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee&amp;rsquo;s prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of section 490:2A-303(d) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor.
