In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs: (1) When the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified; (2) When the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or (3) When the young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals.
