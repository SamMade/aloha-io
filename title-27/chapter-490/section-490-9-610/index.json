(b) Every aspect of a disposition of collateral, including the method, manner, time, place, and other terms, must be commercially reasonable. If commercially reasonable, a secured party may dispose of collateral by public or private proceedings, by one or more contracts, as a unit or in parcels, and at any time and place and on any terms. &amp;copy; A secured party may purchase collateral: (1) At a public disposition; or (2) At a private disposition only if the collateral is of a kind that is customarily sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations. (d) A contract for sale, lease, license, or other disposition includes the warranties relating to title, possession, quiet enjoyment, and the like which by operation of law accompany a voluntary disposition of property of the kind subject to the contract. (e) A secured party may disclaim or modify warranties under subsection (d): (1) In a manner that would be effective to disclaim or modify the warranties in a voluntary disposition of property of the kind subject to the contract of disposition; or (2) By communicating to the purchaser a record evidencing the contract for disposition and including an express disclaimer or modification of the warranties. (f) A record is sufficient to disclaim warranties under subsection (e) if it indicates, &amp;ldquo;There is no warranty relating to title, possession, quiet enjoyment, or the like in this disposition&amp;rdquo; or uses words of similar import.
