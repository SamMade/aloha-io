Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede any inconsistent provision of this article to the extent of the inconsistency. [L 1991, c 41, pt of ยง1]4-106; HRS ยง490:4-106; am and ren L 1991, c 118, pt of ยง4] Case Notes Where defendant argued that although there is no case law directly on point, Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s uniform commercial code suggests that the State treats bank branches as separate entities, district court predicted that the Hawaii supreme court would decline to adopt the separate entity rule in this case, and therefore concluded that plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s service of writ of execution on the vice-president and manager of bank&amp;rsquo;s legal and custody department in Honolulu was sufficient to garnish defendant&amp;rsquo;s funds in the account defendant opened at the bank branch in American Samoa. 889 F. Supp. 2d 1244 (2012). "
