<p>(2) Transactions validly entered into before January 1, 1967, and the rights, duties, and interests flowing from them remain valid thereafter and may be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced as required or permitted by any statute or other law repealed, amended, or modified by this chapter as though such repeal, amendment, or modification had not occurred; provided that the perfection of a security interest, as defined in this chapter and however denominated in any law repealed, amended, or modified by this chapter:</p>

<p>(a) Which was perfected on January 1, 1967, by a filing or recording under a law repealed by this chapter and requiring a further filing or recording to continue its perfection, continues until and will lapse on the date provided by the law so repealed for such further filing or recording;</p>

<p>(b) Which was perfected on January 1, 1967, by a filing or recording under a law repealed by this chapter and requiring no further filing or recording to continue its perfection, continues until and will lapse twelve months after January 1, 1967;</p>

<p>&copy; Which was perfected on January 1, 1967, without any filing or recording, and for the perfection of which the filing of a financing statement would be required if this chapter applied, continues until and will lapse twelve months after January 1, 1967; unless, in each case, a continuation statement is filed by the secured party before the perfection of the security interest would otherwise lapse. Any such continuation statement must be signed by the secured party, identify the security agreement, statement or notice, however denominated in any law repealed by this chapter, state the office where and the date when the last filing or recording was made with respect thereto, and the filing number, if any, or book and page, if any, of recording and further state that the security agreement, statement or notice, however denominated in any law repealed by this chapter, is still effective.

<p>(a) The perfection of a security interest, however denominated in any law repealed by this chapter, which was perfected on January 1, 1967 by a filing or recording under a law repealed by this chapter, and for the perfection of which, if this chapter applied, no filing of a financing statement would be required, continues under this chapter.</p>

<p>(b) A security interest, however denominated in any law repealed by this chapter, which was not perfected on January 1, 1967 but which could have been perfected before January 1, 1967 by a filing or recording under a law repealed, by this chapter, and which, if this chapter applied, could be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under this chapter, may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with this chapter.</p>

<p>&copy; A security interest, however denominated in any law repealed, amended or modified by this chapter, which was not perfected on January 1, 1967 but which could have been perfected before January 1, 1967 by the secured party&rsquo;s taking possession of the collateral under a law repealed, modified or amended by this chapter, and which, if this chapter applied, could be perfected by the secured party&rsquo;s taking possession of the collateral, may be perfected by the secured party&rsquo;s taking possession of the collateral in accordance with this chapter.
