<p>(2) Transactions validly entered into before January 1, 1967, and the rights, duties, and interests flowing from them remain valid thereafter and may be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced as required or permitted by any statute or other law repealed, amended, or modified by this chapter as though such repeal, amendment, or modification had not occurred; provided that the perfection of a security interest, as defined in this chapter and however denominated in any law repealed, amended, or modified by this chapter:</p>

<p>(a) Which was perfected on January 1, 1967, by a filing or recording under a law repealed by this chapter and requiring a further filing or recording to continue its perfection, continues until and will lapse on the date provided by the law so repealed for such further filing or recording;</p>

<p>(b) Which was perfected on January 1, 1967, by a filing or recording under a law repealed by this chapter and requiring no further filing or recording to continue its perfection, continues until and will lapse twelve months after January 1, 1967;</p>
