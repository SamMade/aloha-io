  "context": "ยง425-114 Partnership registration statement. (a) A filed registration statement supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows: (1) Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed registration statement is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not then contained in the filed registration statement. A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority. (2) A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed registration statement recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property. The recording in the bureau of conveyances of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority. (b) A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed registration statement containing the limitation on authority is of record in the bureau of conveyances. &amp;copy; Except as otherwise provided in subsections (a) and (b) and sections 425-136 and 425-142, a person not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed registration statement.
