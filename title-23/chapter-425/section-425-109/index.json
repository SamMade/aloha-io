(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit forms a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.

(2) The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived. (3) A person who receives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business, unless the profits were received in payment: (A) Of a debt by installments or otherwise; (B) For services as an independent contractor or of wages or other compensation to an employee; &amp;copy; Of rent; (D) Of an annuity or other retirement or health benefit to a beneficiary, representative, or designee of a deceased or retired partner; (E) Of interest or other charge on a loan, even if the amount of payment varies with the profits of the business, including a direct or indirect present or future ownership of the collateral, or rights to income, proceeds, or increase in value derived from the collateral; or (F) For the sale of the goodwill of a business or other property by installments or otherwise.
