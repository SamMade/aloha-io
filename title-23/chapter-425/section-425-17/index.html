      <p><strong>§425-17 Withdrawal procedure for foreign general partnership.</strong> (a) Any foreign general partnership which has qualified to transact business in this State may withdraw and surrender its right to engage in business within this State by securing from the director of commerce and consumer affairs a certificate of withdrawal. Any such general partnership shall file in the office of the director an application for withdrawal, certified and signed by a general partner, which shall set forth:</p>

<p>(1) The name of the foreign general partnership, and the state or country under the laws of which it is formed;</p>

<p>(2) That the foreign general partnership is not transacting business in this State;</p>

<p>(3) That the foreign general partnership surrenders its authority to transact business in this State;</p>

<p>(4) That the foreign general partnership revokes the authority of its registered agent in this State to accept service of process, and consents that service of process in any action, suit, or proceeding based upon any cause of action arising in this State during the time the partnership was authorized to transact business in this State may thereafter be made on the partnership by service thereof on the director;</p>

<p>(5) The dates that notice of the foreign general partnership&rsquo;s intent to withdraw from the State was published, once in each of four successive weeks (four publications) in a daily or weekly publication of statewide circulation or in separate daily or weekly publications whose combined circulation is statewide, or a statement that publication was not made;</p>

<p>(6) That all taxes, debts, obligations, and liabilities of the foreign general partnership in this State have been paid and discharged or that adequate provision has been made therefor;</p>

<p>(7) A mailing address to which the director may mail a copy of any process against the foreign general partnership that may be served on the director; and</p>

<p>(8) Such additional information as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the director to determine and assess any unpaid fees payable by the foreign general partnership.</p>

<p>(b) Upon the filing of the application for withdrawal, and after the payment of a fee of $10, the director shall issue a certificate of withdrawal, which shall be effective as of the date of the filing of the application for withdrawal, and the authority of the foreign general partnership to transact business in this State shall then cease. No such general partnership may withdraw from this State without complying with the aforesaid conditions and until such compliance, service of legal notices and processes may be made on any agent of the general partnership within this State, or if none can be found, service of such notices and processes upon the director of commerce and consumer affairs shall be deemed sufficient service of such notices and processes upon it.
