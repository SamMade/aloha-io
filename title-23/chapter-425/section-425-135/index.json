(a) A partner&amp;rsquo;s dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner&amp;rsquo;s liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b). (b) A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership within two years after the partner&amp;rsquo;s dissociation, only if the partner is liable for the obligation under section 425-117 and at the time of entering into the transaction the other party: (1) Reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner; (2) Did not have notice of the partner&amp;rsquo;s dissociation; and (3) Is not deemed to have had knowledge under section 425-114(b) or notice under section 425-136&amp;copy;. &amp;copy; By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation. (d) A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner&amp;rsquo;s dissociation but without the partner&amp;rsquo;s consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.
