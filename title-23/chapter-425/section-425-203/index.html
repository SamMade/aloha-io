      <p><strong>[ยง425-203]</strong> <strong>Merger of general partnerships and limited liability partnerships.</strong> (a) Pursuant to a plan of merger, a domestic general partnership, foreign general partnership, domestic limited liability partnership, or foreign limited liability partnership may merge with one or more domestic professional corporations or with one or more general partnerships, limited liability partnerships, or other business entities formed or organized under the laws of this State, any state or territory of the United States, any foreign jurisdiction, or any combination thereof, with one of the domestic professional corporations, domestic or foreign general partnerships or limited liability partnerships, or other business entities whether domestic or foreign, being the surviving entity, as provided in the plan; provided that the merger is permitted by the law of the state or country under whose law each foreign entity that is a party to the merger is organized.</p>

<p>(b) The plan of merger shall set forth:</p>

<p>(1) The name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of each entity that is a party to the merger;</p>

<p>(2) The name of the surviving entity with or into which the other entity or entities will merge;</p>

<p>(3) The terms and conditions of the merger;</p>

<p>(4) The manner and basis for converting the interests of each party to the merger into interests or obligations of the surviving entity, or into money or other property in whole or in part;</p>

<p>(5) The street address of the surviving entity&rsquo;s principal place of business, or if no street address is available, the rural post office number or post office box designated or made available by the United States Postal Service; and</p>

<p>(6) Amendments, if any, to the organizing articles of the surviving entity or, if no such amendments are desired, a statement that the organizing articles of the surviving entity shall not be amended pursuant to the merger.</p>

<p>&copy; A plan of merger may:</p>

<p>(1) Amend the partnership agreement of a general partnership or limited liability partnership; or</p>

<p>(2) Adopt a new partnership agreement, for a general partnership or limited liability partnership if it is the surviving entity in the merger.</p>

<p>Any amendment to a partnership agreement or adoption of a new partnership agreement made pursuant [to] this subsection shall be effective upon the effective date of the merger. This subsection shall not limit the accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to in this subsection by any other means provided for in a general partnership&rsquo;s or limited liability partnership&rsquo;s partnership agreement or other agreement, or as otherwise permitted by law; provided that the partnership agreement of any constituent partnership or limited liability partnership to the merger (including a partnership or a limited liability partnership formed for the purpose of consummating a merger) shall be the partnership agreement of the surviving general partnership or limited liability partnership.</p>

<p>(d) A plan of merger may set forth other provisions relating to the merger.</p>

<p>(e) A plan of merger shall be approved:</p>

<p>(1) In the case of a domestic general partnership or limited liability partnership that is a party to the merger, unless otherwise provided by the partnership agreement, by the vote of all partners; and</p>

<p>(2) In the case of a foreign general partnership or foreign limited liability partnership that is a party to the merger, by the vote required for approval of a merger by the laws of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which the foreign general partnership or foreign limited liability partnership is organized.</p>

<p>(f) If a foreign general partnership or foreign limited liability partnership is the surviving entity of a merger, it shall not do business in this State until an application for a certificate of authority is filed with the director if the foreign general partnership or foreign limited liability partnership is not already authorized to do business in the State.</p>

<p>(g) The surviving entity shall furnish a copy of the plan of merger, on request and without cost, to any member, shareholder, or partner of any entity that is a party to the merger.</p>

<p>(h) A plan of merger may provide that at any time prior to the time that the plan becomes effective, the plan may be terminated by the partners of any partnership or limited liability partnership notwithstanding approval by all or any of the constituent parties. If the plan of merger is terminated after the filing of the articles but before the plan has become effective, a certificate of termination shall be filed with the director. A plan of merger may allow the partners of the constituent partnerships to amend the plan at any time prior to the time that the plan becomes effective; provided that an amendment made subsequent to the adoption of the plan by the partners of any constituent partnership shall not:</p>

<p>(1) Alter or change the amount or kind of shares, securities, cash, property, or rights to be received in exchange for or on conversion of all or any of the interests of the constituent partnership; or</p>

<p>(2) Alter or change any term of the organizing articles of the surviving entity to be effected by the merger.</p>

<p>If the plan of merger is amended after the articles are</p>

<p>filed with the director but before the plan has become effective, a certificate of amendment shall be filed with the director.</p>

<p>(i) A merger takes effect on the filing date of the articles of merger, or on the date subsequent to the filing as set forth in the articles of merger; provided that the effective date shall not be more than thirty days from the filing date. [L 2002, c 41, pt of ยง3]</p>
