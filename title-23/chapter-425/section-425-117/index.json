(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and &amp;copy;, all partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law. (b) A person admitted as a partner into an existing partnership is not personally liable for any partnership obligation incurred before the person&amp;rsquo;s admission as a partner. &amp;copy; An obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner. This subsection applies notwithstanding anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the vote required to become a limited liability partnership.
