<p>(g) A certified copy of the articles of merger shall be filed with the department of agriculture.</p>

<p>(h) When a merger takes effect:</p>

<p>(2) All property owned by each of the entities that are parties to the merger vests in the surviving entity;</p>

<p>(3) All debts, liabilities, and other obligations of each entity that is a party to the merger become the obligations of the surviving entity;</p>
