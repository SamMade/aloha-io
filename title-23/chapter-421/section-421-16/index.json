Any member may bring charges of misconduct or incompetency against an officer by filing them with the secretary or president of the association, together with a petition signed by ten per cent of the members requesting the removal of the officer in question. The directors shall vote upon the removal of the officer at the first meeting of the board held after the hearing on the charges, and the officer may be removed by a majority vote, notwithstanding any contract the officer may have with the association, which shall terminate upon the officer&amp;rsquo;s removal, anything in the contract to the contrary notwithstanding.
