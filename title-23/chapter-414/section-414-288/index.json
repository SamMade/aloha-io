(a) A corporation&amp;rsquo;s articles of incorporation may be amended without action by the board of directors or shareholders to carry out a plan of reorganization ordered or decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction under federal statute, if the articles of incorporation after amendment contain only provisions required or permitted by section 414-32.
