(a) Action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a shareholders&amp;rsquo; meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed before or after the intended effective date of the action by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. (b) If not otherwise fixed under section 414-123 or 414-127, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first shareholder signs the consent under subsection (a). &amp;copy; A consent signed under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. (d) If this chapter requires that notice of proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by unanimous consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the proposed action at least ten days before the action is taken. The notice shall contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under this chapter, would have been required to be sent to nonvoting shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action. (e) A telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a shareholder, proxy of a shareholder, or person or persons authorized to act for a shareholder or proxy of a shareholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed, and dated for the purposes of this section; provided that the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the corporation may determine: (1) That the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the shareholder, proxy of the shareholder, or person or persons authorized to act for the shareholder or proxy of the shareholder; and (2) The date on which the shareholder, proxy of the shareholder, or authorized person or persons transmitted the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission. The date on which the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which the consent is signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until the consent is reproduced in paper form and delivered to the corporation. (f) Any copy, facsimile, or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used; provided that the copy, facsimile, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.
