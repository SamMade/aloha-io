(b) A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form. The appointment form shall be signed by either the shareholder personally or by the shareholder&amp;rsquo;s attorney-in-fact. A shareholder may authorize another person to act as a proxy for the shareholder by: (1) Executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act as a proxy for the shareholder, which may be accomplished by the shareholder or the shareholder&amp;rsquo;s authorized attorney-in-fact, officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing the shareholder&amp;rsquo;s signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means, including without limitation the use of a facsimile signature; or (2) Transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, facsimile, or other means of electronic transmission authorizing the person or persons to act as a proxy for the shareholder to the person or persons who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or similar agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission; provided that any such transmission shall specify that the transmission was authorized by the shareholder. A copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the foregoing may be used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that any such copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. &amp;copy; An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for eleven months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form. (d) An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include the appointment of: (1) A pledgee; (2) A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares; (3) A creditor of the corporation who extended it credit under terms requiring the appointment; (4) An employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or (5) A party to a voting agreement created under section 414-162. (e) The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy&amp;rsquo;s authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment. (f) An appointment made irrevocable under subsection (d) is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. (g) A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if the transferee did not know of its existence when the transferee acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates. (h) Subject to section 414-145 and to any express limitation on the proxy&amp;rsquo;s authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy&amp;rsquo;s vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.
