A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date. If a resignation is made effective at a later date and the corporation accepts the future effective date, its board of directors may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the board of directors provides that the successor does not take office until the effective date. (b) Any officer may be removed by the board of directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the corporation will be served thereby, but the removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed.
