(b) The terms of all other directors expire at the next annual shareholders&amp;rsquo; meeting following their election unless their terms are staggered under section 414-196. &amp;copy; A decrease in the number of directors does not shorten an incumbent director&amp;rsquo;s term. (d) The term of a director elected to fill a vacancy expires at the next shareholders&amp;rsquo; meeting at which directors are elected. (e) Despite the expiration of a director&amp;rsquo;s term, the director continues to serve until the director&amp;rsquo;s successor is elected and qualifies or until there is a decrease in the number of directors.
