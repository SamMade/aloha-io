After receipt of an application and after giving any notice it considers necessary, the court shall: (1) Order indemnification if the court determines that the director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under section 414-243; (2) Order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification or advance for expenses pursuant to a provision authorized by section 414-249(a); or (3) Order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court determines, in view of all the relevant circumstances, that it is fair and reasonable: (A) To indemnify the director; or (B) To advance expenses to the director, even if the director has not met the relevant standard of conduct set forth in section 414-242(a), failed to comply with section 414-244 or was adjudged liable in a proceeding referred to in section 414-242(d)(1) or (2), but if the director was adjudged so liable the director&amp;rsquo;s indemnification shall be limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.
