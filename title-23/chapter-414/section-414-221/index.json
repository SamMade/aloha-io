(a) A director shall discharge the director&amp;rsquo;s duties as a director, including the director&amp;rsquo;s duties as a member of a committee: (1) In good faith; (2) With the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) In a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. (b) In determining the best interests of the corporation, a director, in addition to considering the interests of the corporation&amp;rsquo;s shareholders, may consider, in the director&amp;rsquo;s discretion, any of the following factors: (1) The interests of the corporation&amp;rsquo;s employees, customers, suppliers, and creditors; (2) The economy of the State and the nation; (3) Community and societal considerations, including, without limitation, the impact of any action upon the communities in or near which the corporation has offices or operations; and (4) The long-term as well as short-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders, including, without limitation, the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation. &amp;copy; In discharging duties as a director, the director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) One or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (2) Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person&amp;rsquo;s professional or expert competence; or (3) A committee of the board of directors of which the director is not a member if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence. (d) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection &amp;copy; unwarranted. (e) A director is not liable for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, if the director performed the duties of the director&amp;rsquo;s office in compliance with this section.
