The director may direct to any professional corporation organized to practice a profession within the jurisdiction of the director and to any officer or director thereof, such interrogatories as may be reasonably necessary and proper to enable the director to ascertain whether the corporation has complied with all of the provisions of this chapter applicable to the corporation. The interrogatories shall be answered within thirty days after the mailing thereof, or within such additional time as shall be fixed by the director, and the answers thereto shall be full and complete and shall be made in writing and under oath. If the interrogatories are directed to an individual, they shall be answered by the individual, and if directed to a professional corporation, they shall be answered by the president, vice president, secretary, or assistant secretary thereof. The director shall certify to the attorney general, for any action the attorney general may deem appropriate, all interrogatories and answers thereto which disclose a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. Interrogatories directed to an individual or a professional corporation by the director and the answers thereto shall not be open to public inspection nor shall the director disclose any facts or information obtained therefrom except insofar as the director&amp;rsquo;s official duty may require the same to be made public or in the event such interrogatories or the answers thereto are required for evidence in any criminal proceeding or any other action by this State.
