(a) When any corporation organized under the laws of this State shall be or shall have been dissolved or shall cease or shall have ceased to exist, the circuit court, upon application of any creditor, member, or director of the corporation, or any other person who shows good cause therefor, and upon a finding that the persons responsible for settling the unfinished business and winding up the affairs of the corporation either are not diligently pursuing such obligations, or cannot be found or otherwise are not available, may either appoint one or more of the directors of the corporation to be trustees or appoint one or more persons to be receivers of and for the corporation, to do all acts that are necessary for the final settlement of the unfinished business of the corporation. The powers of the trustees or receivers shall be effective for the time period determined by the circuit court. (b) The relief provided in this section shall be in addition to, and shall not limit or diminish, any remedies otherwise available under the common law or other state or federal statutes or rules. In the event of a conflict between this section and any common law, statute, or rule on the subject, the more beneficial provisions favoring the applicant shall prevail. [L 2004, c 121, ยง2] "
