The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of merger and contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. The copy or summary of the plan for members of the surviving corporation shall include any provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws, would entitle members to vote on the provision. The copy or summary of the plan for members of the disappearing corporation shall include a copy or summary of the articles and bylaws that will be in effect immediately after the merger takes effect. (e) If the board seeks to have the plan approved by the members by written consent or ballot, the material soliciting the approval shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan.

[(h)] A merger takes effect on the filing date of the articles of merger, or on the date subsequent to the filing as set forth in the articles of merger; provided that the effective date shall not be more than thirty days from the filing date.
