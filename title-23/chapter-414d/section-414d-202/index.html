      <p><strong>ยง414D-202 Action on plan by board, members, and third persons.</strong> (a) Unless this chapter, the articles, the bylaws, or the board of directors or members (acting pursuant to subsection &copy;) require a greater vote or voting by class, a plan of merger to be adopted shall be approved:</p>

<p>(1) By the board;</p>

<p>(2) By the members, if any, by two-thirds of the votes cast or a majority of the voting power, whichever is less; and</p>

<p>(3) In writing by any person or persons whose approval is required by a provision of the articles authorized by section 414D-188 for an amendment to the articles or bylaws.</p>

<p>(b) If the corporation does not have members, the merger shall be approved by a majority of the directors in office at the time the merger is approved. In addition, the corporation shall provide notice of any directors&rsquo; meeting at which the approval is to be obtained in accordance with section 414D-145&copy;. The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the proposed merger.</p>

<p>&copy; The board may condition its submission of the proposed merger, and the members may condition their approval of the merger, on receipt of a higher percentage of affirmative votes or on any other basis.</p>

<p>(d) If the board seeks to have the plan approved by the members at a membership meeting, the corporation shall give notice to its members of the proposed membership meeting in accordance with section 414D-105. The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of merger and contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. The copy or summary of the plan for members of the surviving corporation shall include any provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws, would entitle members to vote on the provision. The copy or summary of the plan for members of the disappearing corporation shall include a copy or summary of the articles and bylaws that will be in effect immediately after the merger takes effect.</p>

<p>(e) If the board seeks to have the plan approved by the members by written consent or ballot, the material soliciting the approval shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. The copy or summary of the plan for members of the surviving corporation shall include any provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws, would entitle members to vote on the provision. The copy or summary of the plan for members of the disappearing corporation shall include a copy or summary of the articles and bylaws that will be in effect immediately after the merger takes effect.</p>

<p>(f) Voting by a class of members is required on a plan of merger if the plan contains a provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation or bylaws, would entitle the class of members to vote as a class on the proposed amendment under section 414D-184 or 414D-187. The plan shall be approved by a class of members by two-thirds of the votes cast by the class or a majority of the voting power of the class, whichever is less.</p>

<p>(g) After a merger is adopted, and at any time before articles of merger are filed, the planned merger may be abandoned (subject to any contractual rights) without further action by members or other persons who approved the plan in accordance with the procedure set forth in the plan of merger or, if none is set forth, in the manner determined by the board of directors. A plan of merger may provide that at any time prior to the time that the plan becomes effective, the plan may be terminated by the board of directors of any constituent corporation notwithstanding approval of the plan by the stockholders of all or any of the constituent corporations. If the plan of merger is terminated after the filing of the articles but before the plan has become effective, a certificate of termination shall be filed with the department director. A plan of merger may allow the boards of directors of the constituent corporations to amend the plan at any time prior to the time that the plan becomes effective; provided that an amendment made subsequent to the adoption of the plan by the stockholders of any constituent corporation shall not:</p>

<p>(1) Alter or change the amount or kind of shares, securities, cash, property, or rights or any of them to be received in exchange for or on conversion of all or any of the interests of the constituent corporation;</p>

<p>(2) Alter or change any term of the organizing articles of the surviving entity to be effected by the merger; or</p>

<p>(3) Alter or change any of the terms and conditions of the plan if the alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any interest of the constituent corporation.</p>

<p>If the plan of merger is amended after the articles are filed with the department director but before the plan has become effective, articles of amendment shall be filed with the department director.</p>

<p>[(h)] A merger takes effect on the filing date of the articles of merger, or on the date subsequent to the filing as set forth in the articles of merger; provided that the effective date shall not be more than thirty days from the filing date.
