(b) In any such proceeding, each complainant shall be a member or director at the time the proceeding is initiated. &amp;copy; A complaint in a proceeding brought on behalf of a corporation shall be verified and allege with particularity the demand made, if any, to obtain action by the directors, and either why the complainants could not obtain the action or why they did not make the demand.
