      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Notice</h2>
      <p><strong>§414D-15 Notice.</strong> (a) Notice may be oral, in the form of an electronic transmission as described in subsections (i) and (j), or written.</p>

<p>(b) Notice may be communicated in person; by telephone, telegraph, teletype, or other form of wire or wireless communication; by mail or private carrier; or by electronic transmission as described in subsections (i) and (j). If these forms of personal notice are impracticable, notice may be communicated by a newspaper of general circulation in the area where it is published; or by radio, television, or other form of public broadcast communication.</p>

<p>&copy; Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner.</p>

<p>(d) Written notice by a domestic or foreign corporation to its members, if in a comprehensible form, shall be effective when mailed, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed to the member&rsquo;s address shown in the corporation&rsquo;s current record of members.</p>

<p>(e) Except as provided in subsection (d), written notice, if in a comprehensible form, is effective at the earliest of the following:</p>

<p>(1) When received;</p>

<p>(2) Five days after its deposit with the United States Postal Service, as evidenced by the postmark; provided the notice is mailed with the correct address and with first class postage affixed; or</p>

<p>(3) On the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee.</p>

<p>(f) Written notice is correctly addressed to a member of a domestic or foreign corporation if addressed to the member&rsquo;s last known address shown in the corporation&rsquo;s current list of members.</p>

<p>(g) A written notice or report delivered as part of a newsletter, magazine, or other publication regularly sent to members shall constitute a written notice or report if addressed or delivered to the member&rsquo;s last known address shown in the corporation&rsquo;s current list of members, or in the case of members who are residents of the same household and who have the same address in the corporation&rsquo;s current list of members, if addressed or delivered to one of the members, at the last known address appearing on the current list of members.</p>

<p>(h) Written notice is correctly addressed to a domestic or foreign corporation (authorized to transact business in the State), other than in its capacity as a member, if addressed to its registered agent or to its secretary at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a foreign corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in its application for a certificate of authority.</p>

<p>(i) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to members or directors, notice to members or directors given by the corporation under this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws shall be effective if provided by electronic transmission consented to by the member or director to whom the notice is given. Any consent shall be revocable by the member or director by written notice or notice by electronic transmission to the corporation. Consent shall be deemed revoked if:</p>

<p>(1) The corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with the consent; and</p>

<p>(2) The inability to deliver becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for giving notice; provided that the inadvertent failure to treat the inability to give electronic notice as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p>

<p>(j) Notice given pursuant to subsection (i) shall be deemed given:</p>

<p>(1) If by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the member or director has consented to receive notice;</p>

<p>(2) If by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the member or director has consented to receive notice;</p>

<p>(3) If by posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the member or director of the specific posting, upon the later of the posting and the giving of the separate notice; and</p>

<p>(4) If by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the member or director.</p>

<p>An affidavit of the secretary, assistant secretary, transfer agent, or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission, in the absence of fraud, shall be prima facie evidence of the fact of notice.</p>

<p>(k) If section 414D-105(b) or any other provision of this chapter prescribes notice requirements for particular circumstances, those requirements shall govern. If articles or bylaws prescribe notice requirements, not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of this chapter, those requirements shall govern.
