(a) If the articles or bylaws provide for cumulative voting by members, members may so vote, by multiplying the number of votes the members are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote, and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates. (b) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, cumulative voting shall not be permitted. If authorized in the articles or bylaws, cumulative voting may be permitted; provided that: (1) The meeting notice or statement accompanying the notice states that cumulative voting shall take place; (2) A member gives notice of the member&amp;rsquo;s intent to cumulatively vote not less than forty-eight hours before the meeting or such longer period as may be required by the articles or bylaws; and (3) If one member gives notice of intent to cumulatively vote, all other members participating in the election may cumulate their votes without giving further notice. &amp;copy; A director elected by cumulative voting may be removed by the members without cause if the requirements of section 414D-138 are met unless the votes cast against removal or not consenting in writing to the removal would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director&amp;rsquo;s most recent election were then being elected; provided that if the action is taken by ballot, all members entitled to vote had voted. (d) Members may not cumulatively vote if the directors and members are identical. [L 2001, c 105, pt of ยง1; am L 2002, c 130, ยง50; am L 2011, c 37, ยง8] "
