(a) Except as provided in subsection (d), a corporation may indemnify a former or current director made a party to a proceeding by reason of the fact that the individual was or is a director, against liability incurred in the proceeding if: (1) The individual conducted the individual&amp;rsquo;s self in good faith; and (2) The individual reasonably believed: (A) In the case of conduct in an official capacity, that the individual&amp;rsquo;s conduct was in the corporation&amp;rsquo;s best interests; (B) In all other cases, the individual&amp;rsquo;s conduct, at a minimum, did not oppose the corporation&amp;rsquo;s best interests; and (3) In the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no reasonable cause to believe the individual&amp;rsquo;s conduct was unlawful. (b) A director&amp;rsquo;s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirements of subsection (a)(2)(B). &amp;copy; The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, is not by itself determinative of a director&amp;rsquo;s failure to meet the standard of conduct described in this section. (d) A corporation may not indemnify a director&amp;rsquo;s liability under this section where the director&amp;rsquo;s liability has been determined: (1) In connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation; or (2) In connection with any other proceeding whether or not involving action in an official capacity, in which the director was found liable on the basis of the director&amp;rsquo;s improper receipt of a personal benefit. (e) Indemnification permitted under this section in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation is limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.
