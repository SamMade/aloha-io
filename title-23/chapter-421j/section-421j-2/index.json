[L 1997, c 132, pt of §1; am L 2001, c 68, §1; am L 2008, c 70, §3; am L 2012, c 182, §2(2)] Case Notes Where charter was not recorded, and because homeowner association&amp;rsquo;s first amended declaration could not reasonably be interpreted as creating the requisite authority in the association to impose a mandatory payment of money for maintenance or services, the association was not an &amp;ldquo;association&amp;rdquo; under the plain meaning of this section; thus, association was not entitled to fees and costs pursuant to §421J-10. 114 H. 361, 162 P.3d 1277 (2007). Where homeowners&amp;rsquo; association did not qualify as an association because it was not granted authority in a declaration satisfying the statutory definition of &amp;ldquo;association&amp;rdquo; in this section, trial court erred in awarding attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees and costs pursuant to §421J-10. 112 H. 356 (App.), 145 P.3d 899 (2006).
