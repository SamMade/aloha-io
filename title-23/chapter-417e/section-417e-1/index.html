      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Definitions</h2>
      <p><strong>§417E-1 Definitions.</strong> As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Affiliate&rdquo; of a person means any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Associate&rdquo; of a person means any person acting jointly or in concert with such person for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of, or exercising any voting rights attached to the equity securities of an issuer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beneficial owner&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, any person who directly or indirectly through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of a security or the power to dispose of, or direct the disposition of, the security. Beneficial ownership includes, but is not limited to, the right, exercisable within sixty days, to acquire securities through the exercise of options, warrants, or rights or the conversion of convertible securities, or otherwise. The securities subject to these options, warrants, rights, or conversion privileges held by a person shall be deemed to be outstanding securities of the class owned by this person, but shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentages of the class owned by any other person. A person shall be deemed the beneficial owner of securities beneficially owned by any relative or spouse or relative of the spouse residing in the home of this person, any trust or estate in which this person owns ten per cent or more of the total beneficial interest or serves as trustee or executor, any corporation or entity in which this person owns ten per cent or more of the equity, and any affiliate or associate of this person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broker-dealer&rdquo; means a &ldquo;broker-dealer&rdquo; as defined in section 485A-102.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; means the commissioner of securities as provided for in chapter 485A.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Equity security&rdquo; means any stock or similar security; or any security convertible, with or without consideration, into such a security; or carrying any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase such a security; or any such warrant or right; or any other security which the commissioner deems to be of similar nature and considers necessary or appropriate, by such rules as the commissioner may prescribe in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to treat as an equity security.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Offeree&rdquo; means the beneficial owner, residing in Hawaii, of equity securities which an offeror offers to acquire in connection with a take-over offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Offeror&rdquo; means a person who makes or in any way participates in making a take-over offer. Offeror does not include any bank or broker-dealer loaning funds to an offeror in the ordinary course of its business, or any bank, broker-dealer, attorney, accountant, consultant, employee, or other person furnishing information or advice to or performing ministerial duties for an offeror, and not otherwise participating in the take-over offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take-over offer&rdquo; means the offer to acquire any equity securities of a target company from a resident of this State pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders, if after the acquisition of all securities acquired pursuant to the offer either the offeror would be directly or indirectly a beneficial owner of more than ten per cent of any class of the outstanding equity securities of the target company; or the beneficial ownership by the offeror of any class of the outstanding equity securities of the target company would be increased by more than five per cent, provided that this does not apply if after the acquisition of all securities acquired pursuant to the offer, the offeror would not be directly or indirectly a beneficial owner of more than ten per cent of any class of the outstanding equity securities of the target company.</p>

<p>Take-over offer does not include:</p>

<p>(1) An offer to exchange the securities of one issuer for the securities of another issuer, if the offer is registered or exempt from registration under this chapter;</p>

<p>(2) An offer in connection with the acquisition of a security which, together with all other acquisitions by the offeror of securities of the same class of equity securities of the issuer, would not result in the offeror having acquired more than two per cent of this class during the preceding twelve-month period;</p>

<p>(3) An offer by the issuer to acquire its own equity securities;</p>

<p>(4) An offer which is approved in writing by the board of directors of the target company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Target company&rdquo; means an issuer of publicly traded equity securities which is organized under the laws of the State or has at least twenty per cent of its equity securities beneficially held by residents of this State, and has substantial assets in this State. For the purposes of this chapter, an equity security is publicly traded if a trading market exists for the security at the time the offeror makes a take-over offer for the security. A trading market exists if the security is traded on a national securities exchange, whether or not registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the over-the-counter market. [L 1985, c 32, pt of §2; am L 2001, c 129, §59; am L 2006, c 229, §9; am L 2007, c 9, §17]</p>
