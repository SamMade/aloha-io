(d) Within five days after receipt of an information statement pursuant to subsection &amp;copy;, a special meeting of the shareholders of the issuing public corporation shall be called pursuant to section 414-122, to vote on the proposed control share acquisition. The meeting shall be held no later than fifty-five days after receipt of the information statement, unless the acquiring person agrees to a later date and no sooner than thirty days after receipt of the information statement, unless the acquiring person so requests in writing when delivering the information statement. The notice of the meeting at a minimum shall be accompanied by a copy of the information statement, and a statement disclosing that the issuing public company recommends: (1) Acceptance of; (2) Expresses no opinion and is remaining neutral toward; or (3) Is unable to take a position with respect to; the proposed control share acquisition.
