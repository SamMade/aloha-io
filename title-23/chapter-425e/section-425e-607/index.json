  "context": "[ยง425E-607] Liability to other persons of person dissociated as a general partner.**** (a) A person&amp;rsquo;s dissociation as a general partner shall not of itself discharge the person&amp;rsquo;s liability as a general partner for an obligation of the limited partnership incurred before dissociation. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and &amp;copy;, the person shall not be liable for a limited partnership&amp;rsquo;s obligation incurred after dissociation. (b) A person whose dissociation as a general partner resulted in a dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership&amp;rsquo;s activities shall be liable to the same extent as a general partner under section 425E-404 on an obligation incurred by the limited partnership under section 425E-804. &amp;copy; A person that has dissociated as a general partner but whose dissociation did not result in a dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership&amp;rsquo;s activities shall be liable on a transaction entered into by the limited partnership after the dissociation only if: (1) A general partner would be liable on the transaction; and (2) At the time the other party enters into the transaction: (A) Less than two years has passed since the dissociation; and (B) The other party does not have notice of the dissociation and reasonably believes that the person is a general partner. (d) By agreement with a creditor of a limited partnership and the limited partnership, a person dissociated as a general partner may be released from liability for an obligation of the limited partnership. (e) A person dissociated as a general partner shall be released from liability for an obligation of the limited partnership if the limited partnership&amp;rsquo;s creditor, with notice of the person&amp;rsquo;s dissociation as a general partner but without the person&amp;rsquo;s consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of the obligation.
