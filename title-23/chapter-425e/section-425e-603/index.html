<p>&copy; The person is a corporation and, within ninety days after the limited partnership notifies the person that it will be expelled as a general partner because it has filed a certificate of dissolution or the equivalent, its charter has been revoked, or its right to transact business has been suspended by the jurisdiction of its incorporation, there is no revocation of the certificate of dissolution or no reinstatement of its charter or its right to transact business; or</p>

<p>(D) The person is a limited liability company or partnership that has been dissolved and whose business is being wound up;</p>

<p>&copy; A judicial determination that the person has otherwise become incapable of performing the person&rsquo;s duties as a general partner under the partnership agreement;</p>

<p>(8) In the case of a person that is a trust or is acting as a general partner by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, distribution of the trust&rsquo;s entire transferable interest in the limited partnership, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor trustee;</p>

<p>(9) In the case of a person that is an estate or is acting as a general partner by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, distribution of the estate&rsquo;s entire transferable interest in the limited partnership, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor personal representative;</p>
