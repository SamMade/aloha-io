  "context": "[ยง428-209] Filing by judicial act. If a person required by section 428-205, or otherwise by this chapter, to sign a record fails or refuses to do so, any other person who is adversely affected by such failure or refusal may petition the circuit court to direct the failing or refusing person to sign the record. If the court finds that it is proper for the record to be signed and that a person so designated has failed or refused to sign the record, it shall authorize another person to sign, on behalf of the person refusing or failing to sign, and to file an appropriate record.
