  "context": "[ยง428-504] Rights of creditors. (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member of a limited liability company or a member&amp;rsquo;s transferee, a court having jurisdiction may order that the distributional interest of the judgment debtor be used to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver to carry out the provisions of the charging order. (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor&amp;rsquo;s distributional interest. The court may order a foreclosure of a lien on a distributional interest subject to the charging order at any time. A purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee. &amp;copy; At any time before foreclosure, a distributional interest in a limited liability company which is charged may be redeemed: (1) By the judgment debtor; (2) With property other than the company&amp;rsquo;s property, by one or more of the other members; or (3) With the company&amp;rsquo;s property, but only if permitted by the operating agreement. (d) This chapter does not affect a member&amp;rsquo;s right under exemption laws with respect to the member&amp;rsquo;s distributional interest in a limited liability company. (e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or a transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor&amp;rsquo;s distributional interest in a limited liability company.
