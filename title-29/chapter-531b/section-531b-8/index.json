(a) Any person signing a funeral service agreement, cremation authorization form, or any other authorization for disposition shall be deemed to warrant the truthfulness of any facts set forth therein, including the identity of the decedent whose remains are to be buried, cremated, or otherwise disposed of, and the party&amp;rsquo;s authority to order the disposition. (b) A funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, or crematory shall have the right to rely on the funeral service agreement, cremation authorization form, or any other authorization form, including the identification of the decedent, and shall have the authority to carry out the instructions of the person or persons whom the funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, or crematory reasonably believes to hold the right of disposition. &amp;copy; The funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, or crematory shall have no responsibility to verify the identity of the decedent or contact or independently investigate the existence of any person who may have a right of disposition. If there is more than one person in the same priority class pursuant to section 531B-4 and the funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, or crematory has no knowledge of any objection by other members of the priority class, it may rely on and act according to the instructions of the first person in the priority class to make funeral and disposition arrangements; provided that no other person in the priority class provides written notice to the funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, or crematory of that person&amp;rsquo;s objections.
