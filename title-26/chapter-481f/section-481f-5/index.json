(a) Notwithstanding any provision in any other law to the contrary, whenever the seller of print multiples furnishes a purchaser informational details required by section 481F-4, such information shall be presumed to be part of the basis of the bargain and shall create an express warranty as to the information furnished. (b) The express warranty shall not be negated or limited because the seller did not have a specific intention or authorization to make a warranty or because any information furnished to the purchaser purports to be merely the seller&amp;rsquo;s opinion. &amp;copy; The existence of a factual basis for the information furnished to the purchaser shall not be a defense against the purchaser in an action to enforce the express warranty.
