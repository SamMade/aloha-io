Whenever the value of property is to be determined under sections 486K-4 and 486K-5, the following shall apply: (1) Value means the market value of the property. (2) Whether or not they have been issued or delivered, certain written instruments, not including those having a readily ascertained market value, shall be evaluated as follows: (A) The value of an instrument constituting an evidence of debt, such as a check, traveler&amp;rsquo;s check, draft, or promissory note, shall be deemed the amount due or collectible thereon or thereby, that figure ordinarily being the face amount of the indebtedness less any portion thereof which has been satisfied; (B) The value of any other instrument that creates, releases, discharges, or otherwise affects any valuable legal right, privilege, or obligation shall be deemed the greatest amount of economic loss which the owner of the instrument might reasonably suffer by virtue of the loss of the instrument. (3) When property has value but that value cannot be ascertained pursuant to the standards set forth above, the value shall be deemed to be an amount not exceeding $50. [L 1978, c 234, pt of ยง3] "
