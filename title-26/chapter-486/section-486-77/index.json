This paragraph shall not be construed to preclude legitimate repair, replacement, or adjustment of an odometer, provided that the administrator may require documentation of such repair, replacement, or adjustment; (2) Advertise for sale, or sell, rent, lease, or export any passenger car, the odometer of which has been tampered with in such a fashion or manner as to mislead the prospective buyer to believe that the passenger car traveled a lesser distance than it actually has traveled; (3) Operate a passenger car on any street or highway, knowing that the odometer of the passenger car is disconnected or nonfunctional; (4) Disconnect, turn back, advance, or reset the odometer of any passenger car with intent to alter the distance indicated on the odometer; or (5) Misrepresent the true distance traveled by any passenger car subject to this part, so as to mislead a prospective buyer. (b) This section shall not preclude the installation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of odometers when such action is necessary to cause compliance with this part. Any such action, however, shall expressly be noted on the certificate of ownership and called to the attention of a prospective buyer, in writing. [L 1988, c 156, pt of ยง3; am L 2008, c 19, ยง53] "
