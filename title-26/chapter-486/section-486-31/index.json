Any authorized inspector or other authorized measurement standards personnel may, upon arresting any person for violation of this chapter, including rules adopted thereunder, take the name, address, and any other pertinent information of the person and issue the person a citation and notice to appear, printed in the form hereinafter described, and answer to the charge against the person at a certain place and at a time as prescribed by the district courts. There shall be a form of citation and notice to appear for use in citing violators of this chapter and the rules adopted thereunder by the board, which does not mandate the taking into custody of such violators. The form and contents of the citation and notice to appear shall be as adopted or prescribed by the district courts. In every case when a citation and notice to appear is issued, it shall be consistent with the provisions established by the district courts. Every citation and notice to appear shall be consecutively numbered and each carbon copy shall bear the number of its respective original. Any person who fails to appear at the place and within the time specified in the citation and notice to appear shall be guilty of a violation as provided in the penal code. Any authorized inspector may cite and, incident to such citation, seize, without formal warrant, incorrect or unsealed measures, measurement standards, or amounts or packages of commodity found to be used, retained, offered, or exposed for sale or sold in violation of law. Any authorized inspector may stop any vehicle subject to this chapter where probable cause exists and require the driver to move the vehicle to a designated place for inspection. Any authorized inspector may enter and go into or upon at any reasonable time, without formal warrant, after having made a reasonable attempt to identify the inspector in accordance with the law, any structure, premises, or any other place where commercial transactions or articles subject to this chapter are being conducted or are located, provided that, when competent authority objects to the entry, a warrant shall be obtained prior to entry. When a complaint is made to any prosecuting officer of the violation of any of the parts of this chapter and the arrest or prosecution of the violator is sought, the arresting officer or employee who issued the citation and notice to appear shall subscribe to it under oath administered by an official, whose name has been submitted to the prosecuting officer and who has been designated by the administrator to administer oaths and, upon probable cause, the court may issue a warrant for the violator.
