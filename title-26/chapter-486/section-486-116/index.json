Whenever any commodity or service is bought or sold, or is offered, exposed, or advertised for sale or purchase, by weight, measure, or count, the price shall not be misrepresented, nor presented in any manner calculated or tending to mislead or deceive an actual or prospective purchaser or seller. The price of consumer commodities, when offered for sale at retail, shall be clearly displayed and shall reflect the retail price at which the public may, without special credentials or other requirements, purchase the commodities. The price displayed and the price actually charged the purchaser shall be identical unless a prior agreement has been reached between the buyer and the seller or the price charged is lower than the price displayed. Whenever an advertised, posted, or labeled price per unit of measure includes a fraction of a cent, all numerals expressing the fraction shall be prominently displayed and the numeral or numerals expressing the fraction shall be immediately adjacent to and of the same general design and style as the whole numeral or numerals of the price per unit as established by rule of the board.
