As §661-8 disallows prejudgment interest on claims against the State, except in certain, identified instances, the State did not waive its sovereign immunity from an award of prejudgment interest under §661-8, and this section did not contradict or supersede the limitation of the State&amp;rsquo;s obligation to pay prejudgment interest only upon a &amp;ldquo;contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest&amp;rdquo;, the circuit court did not err when it denied plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; request for prejudgment interest. 122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).
