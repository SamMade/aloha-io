Prior to charging any fee or charge, the credit card issuer shall disclose the fee or charge to the credit cardholder in the credit card agreement or in an amendment to the credit card agreement. As used in this subsection, &amp;ldquo;interest&amp;rdquo; means the simple interest numerical periodic rate and any other fee, charge, or payment, directly or indirectly charged or received as an incident to or a condition of an extension of credit under a credit card agreement, including but not limited to: (1) A currency exchange conversion fee; (2) A late fee; (3) A creditor-imposed &amp;ldquo;not sufficient funds&amp;rdquo; fee charged when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds; (4) An over-the-credit limit fee; (5) An annual fee or other periodic membership fee; (6) A balance transfer fee; (7) A cash advance fee; or (8) A minimum finance charge.
