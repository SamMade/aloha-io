If the club card issuer requires a unique identifier to confirm the identity of the applicant, the club card issuer may ask for the last four digits of the applicant&amp;rsquo;s social security number. (b) No club card issuer may sell or share a cardholders name, address, telephone number, or any personal information to any unaffiliated third party except as permitted in this subsection.
