On or before closing of probate of a deceased person&amp;rsquo;s estate, the publicity rights of the deceased person shall vest in the transferees of the personal property of the estate in conformity with the deceased person&amp;rsquo;s will or probate order. If publicity rights are not expressly addressed by the terms of the will or a probate order, and if a publicity rights name registration is not in effect at the time of the relevant assignment or license, after probate closes, any one of the transferees of the personal property of the deceased person&amp;rsquo;s estate shall have the right to assign or license the publicity rights of the deceased person, and a valid license from any of the transferees of the personal property of the deceased person&amp;rsquo;s estate shall constitute a complete defense to any infringement action under this section. &amp;copy; Any person seeking to license publicity rights from a living person shall have the right to presume that a living individual or personality has the right to assign or license the individual&amp;rsquo;s or personality&amp;rsquo;s publicity rights unless there is a publicity rights name registration for that individual or personality. If there is a publicity rights name registration for that individual or personality, the person seeking to license publicity rights shall inform the living person in writing that an assignment or license shall be sought from the holder of the publicity rights name registration before entering into the assignment or license. (d) If there is a publicity rights name registration for a given individual or personality, any person seeking to license publicity rights for that individual or personality shall have the right to presume that the holder of the publicity rights name registration has the right to assign or license the individual&amp;rsquo;s or personality&amp;rsquo;s publicity rights and a valid license from the registered holder of the publicity rights name registration shall constitute a complete defense to any infringement action under this section; provided that the assignee or transferee has kept the publicity rights name registration active and in force and maintained the accuracy of the information in the publicity rights name registration filing. (e) A person commits an offense if the person signs, manually or via electronic means, a document the person knows is false in any material respect with the intent that the document be delivered or transmitted to the director in connection with a publicity rights name registration under this section. An offense under this subsection shall be a class C felony and may carry a fine not to exceed $10,000.
