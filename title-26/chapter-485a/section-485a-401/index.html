<p>(b) The following persons are exempt from the registration requirement of subsection (a):</p>

<p>(1) A broker-dealer without a place of business in this State if its only transactions effected in this State are with:</p>

<p>(A) The issuer of the securities involved in the transactions;</p>

<p>(B) A broker-dealer registered as a broker-dealer under this chapter or not required to be registered as a broker-dealer under this chapter;</p>
