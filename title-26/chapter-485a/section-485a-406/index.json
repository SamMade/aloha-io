  "context": "[§485A-406] Registration by broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, and investment adviser representative. (a) A person shall register as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative by filing an application and a consent to service of process complying with section 485A-610, and paying the fee specified in section 485A-410 and any reasonable fees charged by the commissioner for processing the filing. The application shall contain: (1) The information required for the filing of a uniform application; and (2) Upon request by the commissioner, any other financial or other information that the commissioner determines is appropriate. (b) If the information or record contained in an application filed under subsection (a) is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete in a material respect, the registrant shall promptly file a correcting amendment. &amp;copy; If an order is not in effect and a proceeding is not pending under section 485A-412, registration becomes effective at noon on the forty-fifth day after a completed application is filed, unless the registration is denied or the commissioner has given written notice of deficiencies that are unresolved. A rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may set an earlier effective date or may defer the effective date until noon on the forty-fifth day after the filing of any amendment completing the application. (d) A registration is effective until midnight on December 31 of the year for which the application for registration is filed. Unless an order is in effect under section 485A-412, a registration may be automatically renewed each year by filing records that are required by rule adopted or order issued under this chapter to be filed, by paying the fee specified in section 485A-410, and by paying costs charged by the commissioner for processing the filings. (e) A rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may impose other conditions, not inconsistent with the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. An order issued under this chapter may waive, in whole or in part, specific requirements in connection with registration as are in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
