(a) Any international trade agreement entered into by the President of the United States that contains provisions relating in any manner to procurement by the states shall not be valid as to those procurement provisions as it applies to this State, unless the legislature by a simple majority vote on a concurrent resolution approves of those procurement provisions. The legislature shall consider, among other things, the effect of an international trade agreement upon procurement preferences and upon the possibility of foreign governments ceasing to do business with the State. (b) When the federal government notifies the State of an impending international trade agreement and seeks the State&amp;rsquo;s approval when the legislature is not in session, the governor shall notify the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives. The legislature may consider approval of the procurement provisions during a special session convened as provided in article III, section 10, of the Hawaii state constitution. The governor may not approve a trade agreement without legislative approval of its procurement provisions by a simple majority vote on a concurrent resolution. [L Sp 2007, c 1, pt of ยง2] "
