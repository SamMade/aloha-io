(b) A requirement to retain a record in accordance with subsection (a) shall not apply to any information the sole purpose of which is to enable the record to be sent, communicated, or received. &amp;copy; A person may satisfy subsection (a) by using the services of another person if the requirements of that subsection are satisfied. (d) If a law requires a record to be presented or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if the record is not presented or retained in its original form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained in accordance with subsection (a). (e) If a law requires retention of a check, that requirement is satisfied by retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the check in accordance with subsection (a). (f) A record retained as an electronic record in accordance with subsection (a) satisfies a law requiring a person to retain a record for evidentiary, audit, or like purposes, unless a law enacted after June 28, 2000 specifically prohibits the use of an electronic record for the specified purpose.
