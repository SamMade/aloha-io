(b) The attorney general shall update the directory as necessary to correct mistakes and to add or remove a tobacco product manufacturer or brand family to keep the directory in conformity with the requirements of this chapter. &amp;copy; Every entity licensed under chapter 245 shall: (1) Provide to the attorney general and update as necessary an electronic mail address for the purpose of receiving any notifications hereunder; and (2) Not later than thirty days after the end of each month, and more frequently if so directed by the attorney general, submit to the attorney general such information as the attorney general requires to facilitate compliance with this chapter, including but not limited to: (A) A list by brand family of the total number of cigarettes, or in the case of roll-your-own, the equivalent stick count for which the licensee affixed stamps during the previous calendar month or otherwise paid the tax due for such cigarettes; and (B) Samples of each brand family, as may be necessary to enable the attorney general to determine whether a tobacco product manufacturer or licensed entity is in compliance with this chapter. (3) Maintain, and make available to the attorney general, all invoices and documentation of sales of all nonparticipating manufacturer cigarettes and any other information relied upon in reporting to the attorney general for a period of five years.
