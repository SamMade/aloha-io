      <h2 class="hrsSection-h2">Certification; participating manufacturers; nonparticipating manufacturers</h2>
      <p><strong>[ยง486P-5] Certification; participating manufacturers; nonparticipating manufacturers.</strong> (a) Every tobacco product manufacturer whose cigarettes are sold in this State, whether directly or through a distributor, retailer, or similar intermediary or intermediaries, shall execute and deliver in the manner prescribed by the attorney general, a certification to the attorney general no later than September 30, 2003, and no later than the thirtieth day of April each year thereafter, certifying that as of the date of the certification the tobacco product manufacturer is either a participating manufacturer or is in full compliance with section 675-3(b).</p>

<p>(b) A participating manufacturer shall include in its certification a list of its brand families. The participating manufacturer shall update the list thirty days prior to any addition to or modification of its brand families by executing and delivering a supplemental certification to the attorney general.</p>

<p>&copy; A nonparticipating manufacturer shall include in its certification:</p>

<p>(1) A complete list of all of its brand families that identifies by name and address any other manufacturer of the brand families, and that includes:</p>

<p>(A) A list of all of its brand families of cigarettes and of the number of units sold for each brand family that was sold in the State during the preceding calendar year, indicating by an asterisk any brand family that is no longer being sold in the State as of the date of the certification; and</p>

<p>(B) A list of its brand families that have been sold in the State at any time during the current calendar year.</p>

<p>The nonparticipating manufacturer shall update the list thirty days prior to any addition to or modification of its brand families by executing and delivering a supplemental certification to the attorney general;</p>

<p>(2) A statement that such nonparticipating manufacturer is registered to do business in the State, or that such nonparticipating manufacturer is a nonresident or foreign nonparticipating manufacturer that has not registered to do business in this State as a foreign corporation or business entity and has appointed an agent for service of process and provided notice thereof pursuant to section 486P-4;</p>

<p>(3) A statement that the nonparticipating manufacturer has established and continues to maintain a qualified escrow fund required pursuant to section 675-3(b)(1), including:</p>

<p>(A) The name, address, and telephone number of the financial institution where the nonparticipating manufacturer has established such qualified escrow fund;</p>

<p>(B) The account number of the qualified escrow fund or any sub-account number for the State;</p>

<p>&copy; The amount the nonparticipating manufacturer placed in such fund for cigarettes sold in the State during the preceding calendar year, the date and amount of each such deposit, and such evidence or verification as may be deemed necessary by the attorney general to confirm the foregoing; and</p>

<p>(D) The amount and date of any withdrawal or transfer of funds the nonparticipating manufacturer made at any time from the fund or from any other qualified escrow fund into which the nonparticipating manufacturer made escrow payments pursuant to section 675-3(b)(1);</p>

<p>(4) A statement that the nonparticipating manufacturer has executed a qualified escrow agreement that has been reviewed and approved by the attorney general and that governs the qualified escrow fund; and</p>

<p>(5) A statement that the nonparticipating manufacturer is in full compliance with this chapter, chapter 675, and any rules adopted to implement this chapter or chapter 675.</p>

<p>(d) A tobacco product manufacturer may not include a brand family in its certification unless:</p>

<p>(1) In the case of a participating manufacturer, the participating manufacturer affirms that the brand family is to be deemed to be its cigarettes for purposes of calculating its payments under the Master Settlement Agreement for the relevant year, in the volume and shares determined pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement; and</p>

<p>(2) In the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, the nonparticipating manufacturer affirms that the brand family is to be deemed to be its cigarettes for purposes of chapter 675.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or otherwise affecting the State&rsquo;s right to maintain that a brand family constitutes cigarettes of a different tobacco product manufacturer for purposes of calculating payments under the Master Settlement Agreement or for purposes of chapter 675.</p>

<p>(e) The attorney general may require at any time from the nonparticipating manufacturer proof, from the financial institution in which a tobacco product manufacturer has established a qualified escrow fund for the purpose of compliance with section 675-3(b)(1), of the amount of money in such fund, exclusive of interest, the amount and date of each deposit to such fund, and the amount and date of each withdrawal from such fund.</p>

<p>(f) A tobacco product manufacturer shall maintain and make available to the attorney general, pursuant to this chapter, all invoices and documentation of sale and other such information relied upon for certification for a period of five years unless otherwise required by law.
