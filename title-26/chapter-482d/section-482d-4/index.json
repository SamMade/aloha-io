(a) The actual variation of fineness of silver or alloy of articles made in whole or in part of silver or its alloys shall not be less by more than .004 parts than the actual fineness indicated by any mark (other than the word &amp;ldquo;sterling&amp;rdquo; or the word &amp;ldquo;coin&amp;rdquo;) stamped upon any part of the article. (b) No article shall be stamped with the word &amp;ldquo;ster&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sterling&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;sterling silver&amp;rdquo; or any colorable imitation thereof, unless the article contains .925 parts pure silver. &amp;copy; No article shall be stamped with the words &amp;ldquo;coin&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;coin silver&amp;rdquo; or any colorable imitation thereof, unless the article contains .900 parts pure silver; provided, however: (1) That in the case of all articles whose fineness is indicated by the word &amp;ldquo;sterling&amp;rdquo; or the word &amp;ldquo;coin&amp;rdquo; there shall be allowed a divergence in the fineness of .004 parts from these standards; (2) That in any test for the ascertainment of the fineness of any article mentioned in this section that part of the article taken for the test shall be such part as does not contain any solder or alloy of inferior fineness used for brazing or uniting the parts of such article; and (3) That in the case of any article mentioned in this section in addition to the foregoing tests and standards, the actual fineness of the entire quantity of silver or of its alloys contained in the articles, including all solder and alloy of inferior fineness used for brazing or uniting the parts of such article (all such silver, alloys, and solder being assayed as one piece), shall not be less by more than .010 parts than the fineness indicated by the mark stamped upon the article.
