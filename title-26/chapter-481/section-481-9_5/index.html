<p>(b) Any person who sells or offers to sell any products or services to a consumer pursuant to a consumer contract that has a specified contract term of twelve months or more, under which the contract will automatically renew for a specified term of more than one month unless the consumer cancels the consumer contract, shall notify the consumer clearly and conspicuously:</p>

<p>(1) That the consumer contract will automatically renew unless the consumer cancels the contract;</p>

<p>(2) How to cancel the contract; and</p>

<p>(3) The deadline by which the consumer shall respond to cancel the consumer contract and prevent automatic renewal.</p>

<p>(2) Consumer elects to receive electronic communications and provides a valid electronic-mail address for the purpose of receiving the notice required by this section.</p>

<p>(d) Any person who sells or offers to sell any products or services to a consumer pursuant to a consumer contract that contains a continuous service clause shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the continuous service clause and the procedure by which the consumer can cancel the contract.</p>

<p>(e) No person shall charge the consumer&rsquo;s credit or debit card or the consumer&rsquo;s account with a third party for an automatic renewal or a continuous service without first obtaining the consumer&rsquo;s affirmative consent to the agreement containing the automatic renewal offer terms or continuous service offer terms.</p>

<p>(f) Any person who sells or offers to sell products or services subject to this section shall provide the consumer with an acknowledgment that the consumer may retain the automatic renewal or continuous service offer terms, cancellation policy, and procedure by which the consumer may cancel the contract. If the offer includes a free trial, the acknowledgment shall also clearly and conspicuously disclose the right of the consumer to cancel before payment is made for the goods or services and the cancellation procedure.</p>

<p>(g) A person making automatic renewal or continuous service offers pursuant to a consumer contract shall include a toll-free telephone number, electronic-mail address, postal address if the seller directly bills the consumer, or a clearly and conspicuously described cost-effective, timely, and easy-to-use alternative means to communicate the cancellation.</p>

<p>(h) In the case of a material change in the terms of the automatic renewal or continuous service offer pursuant to a consumer contract that has been accepted by a consumer in Hawaii, the person shall clearly and conspicuously provide the consumer with a notice of the material change and provide information regarding how to cancel in a manner that is capable of being retained by the consumer prior to the implementation of the material change.</p>

<p>(i) Any person who knowingly violates this section or who knowingly fails to cancel an automatic renewal contract or a continuous service contract upon consumer request shall be deemed to have engaged in an unfair method of competition and unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within the meaning of section 480-2.</p>
