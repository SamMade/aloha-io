A government agency shall submit a written report to the legislature within twenty days after the discovery of a material occurrence of a social security number disclosure by the government agency that is prohibited by this chapter. The report shall contain information relating to the nature of the incident, the number of individuals affected by the incident, and any procedures that have been implemented to prevent the incident from reoccurring.
