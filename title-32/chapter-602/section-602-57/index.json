Case Notes Section 174C-60 is inconsistent with and cannot stand together with §602-5 and this section, as amended by Act 202, L 2004, and was deemed amended by implication, effective July 1, 2006, to authorize appeals from the water commission to the intermediate appellate court, not to the supreme court. 113 H. 52, 147 P.3d 836 (2006). Where bankruptcy court remanded the entirety of the adversary proceeding to the circuit court, and petitioner timely appealed to the appellate court the bankruptcy court&amp;rsquo;s good faith determination which had not been modified or set aside by the circuit court and thus remained in effect, since this section gives the appellate court jurisdiction over appeals from the circuit court that are &amp;ldquo;allowed by law&amp;rdquo;, and §663-15.5(e) authorized an appeal from the good faith determination, the appellate court had jurisdiction over the appeal. 125 H. 186, 256 P.3d 694 (2011).
