The judges of all the courts of the State shall have discretionary power to waive the prepayment of costs or to reduce or remit costs where, in special or extraordinary cases, the cost of any suit, action, or proceeding may, to the judges, appear onerous.

In exercising discretion, court may consider movants&amp;rsquo; estate or their net worth. 2 H. App. 1, 625 P.2d 378 (1981).
