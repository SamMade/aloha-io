  "context": "§607-9 Cost charges exclusive; disbursements. [(a)] No other costs of court shall be charged in any court in addition to those prescribed in this chapter in any suit, action, or other proceeding, except as otherwise provided by law. [(b)] All actual disbursements, including but not limited to, intrastate travel expenses for witnesses and counsel, expenses for deposition transcript originals and copies, and other incidental expenses, including copying costs, intrastate long distance telephone charges, and postage, sworn to by an attorney or a party, and deemed reasonable by the court, may be allowed in taxation of costs. In determining whether and what costs should be taxed, the court may consider the equities of the situation.

As decision to award costs is discretionary and the trial court &amp;ldquo;may&amp;rdquo;, but need not, &amp;ldquo;consider the equities of the situation&amp;rdquo;, trial court did not abuse discretion in refusing to grant plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; motion to disallow costs awarded to defendants as prevailing parties. 112 H. 3, 143 P.3d 1205 (2006).

Although refusing to assess the costs of the depositions against non-prevailing party petitioner was within the courts discretion if the court found that the depositions were not necessarily obtained for use at trial or that to do so would be inequitable, it was error under this section for the court to deny costs to the prevailing party respondent without justification, unless the circumstances justifying the denial of the costs were plain from the record; thus, issue remanded to allow the court to set forth the reasons for not assessing petitioner the deposition costs of petitioner and two doctors. 128 H. 423, 290 P.3d 493 (2012).
