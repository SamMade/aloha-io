Case Notes As each of the districts on the island of Oahu includes archipelagic waters and smaller islands adjacent thereto under this section, where the two dog attacks occurred in shallow water, very close to the shoreline of an Oahu beach, the attacks clearly took place within the waters and archipelagic waters adjacent to the island of Oahu and thus within the city&amp;rsquo;s territorial limits; therefore, the city had the authority to enforce the violations of Revised Ordinances of Honolulu §7-7.2 that defendant was charged with committing, which makes it a crime for a dog owner to negligently fail to control a dangerous dog. 120 H. 486 (App.), 210 P.3d 9 (2009).
