      <p><strong>[ยง6E-10.5] Enforcement.</strong> (a) If the board of land and natural resources determines that any person has violated or is violating this chapter, or any rule adopted pursuant to this chapter, the board shall serve written notice by certified mail or personal service upon the alleged violator or violators specifying the alleged violation and may include with the notice:</p>

<p>(1) An order specifying a reasonable time during which that person shall be required to take such measures as may be necessary to correct the violation and to give periodic progress reports;</p>

<p>(2) An order imposing penalties provided in section 6E-11.6; and</p>

<p>(3) An order that the alleged violator or violators appear before the board for a hearing at a time and place specified in the notice or to be set later and answer the charges complained of.</p>

<p>(b) If the board determines that any person is continuing to violate this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant to this chapter after having been served notice of violation, the board shall serve written notice by certified mail or personal service upon the alleged violator or violators specifying the alleged violation. With the notice, the board:</p>

<p>(1) Shall order the alleged violator or violators to submit a written schedule within thirty days specifying the measures to be taken and the time within which the measures shall be taken to bring that person into compliance with this chapter or any rule adopted thereunder. The board shall accept or modify the submitted schedule within sixty days of receipt of the schedule. Any schedule not acted upon after sixty days of receipt by the board shall be deemed accepted by the board;</p>

<p>(2) Shall order the alleged violator or violators to cease and desist from the activities that violate this chapter or any rule adopted thereunder, if that person does not submit a written schedule to the board within thirty days. This order shall remain in effect until the board accepts the written schedule;</p>

<p>(3) May impose penalties as provided in section 6E-11.6; and</p>

<p>(4) May order the alleged violator or violators to appear before the board for a hearing to answer the charges issued, at a time and place specified in the notice or otherwise set by the board.</p>

<p>&copy; If the board determines that any person has violated an accepted schedule or an order issued pursuant to this section, the board shall impose penalties by sending a notice in writing, either by certified mail or by personal service to that person, describing such non-adherence or violation with reasonable particularity.</p>

<p>(d) Any order issued pursuant to this chapter shall become final, unless the person or persons named therein requests in writing, not later than twenty days after notice of violation and order is served, a hearing before the board. Upon request for a hearing, the board shall require that the alleged violator or violators appear before the board for a hearing to answer the charges issued, at a time and place specified in the notice or otherwise set by the board.</p>

<p>Any penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter shall become due and payable twenty days after the notice of penalty is served, unless the person or persons named therein requests in writing a hearing before the board. Whenever a hearing is requested on any penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter, the penalty shall become due and payable only upon completion of all review proceedings and the issuance of a final order confirming the penalty in whole or in part.</p>

<p>(e) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be conducted as a contested case under chapter 91. If, after a hearing held pursuant to this section, the board finds that a violation or violations has occurred, the board shall:</p>

<p>(1) Affirm or modify any penalties imposed;</p>

<p>(2) Modify or affirm the order previously issued; or</p>

<p>(3) Issue an appropriate order or orders for the prevention, abatement, or control of the violation or for the taking of such other corrective action as may be appropriate.</p>

<p>Any order issued after a hearing may prescribe timetables for necessary action in preventing, abating, or controlling the violation. If, after a hearing on an order or penalty contained in a notice, the board finds that no violation has occurred or is occurring, the board shall rescind the order or penalty.</p>

<p>(f) If the amount of any penalty is not paid to the department within thirty days after it becomes due and payable, the board may institute a civil action in the name of the State to collect the administrative penalty, which shall be a government realization. In any proceeding to collect the administrative penalty imposed, the board need only show that:</p>

<p>(1) Notice was given;</p>

<p>(2) A hearing was held, or the time granted for requesting a hearing has run without such a request;</p>

<p>(3) The administrative penalty was imposed; and</p>

<p>(4) The penalty remains unpaid.</p>

<p>(g) In connection with any hearing held pursuant to this section, the board may subpoena the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence on behalf of all parties. [L 2003, c 104, pt of ยง2]</p>
