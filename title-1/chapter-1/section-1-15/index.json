  "context": "§1-15 Construction of ambiguous context. Where the words of a law are ambiguous: (1) The meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. (2) The reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to enact it, may be considered to discover its true meaning. (3) Every construction which leads to an absurdity shall be rejected.
