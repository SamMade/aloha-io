Any person receiving compensation in conjunction with a use or activity who seeks to qualify as noncommercial shall have the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the department that the fee or charge is strictly a sharing of actual expenses of the use or activity.

The term also includes an agency that holds title to, manages, or controls public land on or under which a cave is located. &amp;ldquo;Paleontological deposit&amp;rdquo; means any remains or fossils of life forms or surface debris that are over fifty years of age and provide a record of past climates and biota. &amp;ldquo;Person&amp;rdquo; shall be as defined in section 1-19. &amp;ldquo;Scientific purposes&amp;rdquo; means research, or exploration, or both, conducted by persons affiliated with recognized scientific organizations with the intent to advance knowledge and to publish the results of exploration or research in an appropriate medium. &amp;ldquo;Speleogen&amp;rdquo; means relief features on the walls, ceiling, or floor of any cave. &amp;ldquo;Speleothem&amp;rdquo; means any secondary natural mineral formation or deposit occurring in a cave, including any stalactite, stalagmite, helictite, cave flower, flowstone, concretion, drapery, rimstone, or formation of clay or other sediment.
