(d) In matters involving other forms of remedies, the office, its officers and employees, and the members of the board shall be subject to suit as provided by any other provision of law and by the common law. [L 1979, c 196, pt of ยง2] Case Notes Where plaintiff office of Hawaiian affairs brought suit in its own corporate name under this section, rather than as an agency of the State on behalf of the people of the State, ยง657-1.5 did not exempt plaintiff from the statute of limitations for bringing a suit under ยง673-10. 110 H. 338, 133 P.3d 767. Plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; complaint failed to state a breach of fiduciary duty claim under subsection &amp;copy;, where the complaint: (1) did not allege that the office of Hawaiian affairs trustees&amp;rsquo; spending decisions were made for any purpose other than benefiting native Hawaiians; (2) did not allege that the expenditures were in conflict with or adverse to the interests of native Hawaiians; and (3) lacked factual allegations that the expenditures were in furtherance of programs that do not benefit native Hawaiians. The conclusory allegations in the amended complaint, without more, were insufficient to state a claim. 131 H. 62, 315 P.3d 213 (2013). "
