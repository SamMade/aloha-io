Rev. 377. Case Notes Definition of &amp;ldquo;Hawaiian&amp;rdquo; does not violate equal protection. 631 F. Supp. 1153. Act 304, L 1990, was invalidated by its own severability clause when amendment to this section by Act 304 was found to conflict with the federal Forgiveness Act (Pub. L. No. 105-66, §340, 111 Stat. at 1448), leaving court with no judicially manageable standards to determine whether office of Hawaiian affairs was entitled to the specific revenues sought in the suit. 96 H. 388, 31 P.3d 901.
