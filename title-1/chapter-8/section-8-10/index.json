December 8 of each year shall be known and designated as &amp;ldquo;Bodhi Day&amp;rdquo; in recognition that on this day Prince Siddhartha Gautama, after six years of study and rigorous ascetic practices and meditation, attained &amp;ldquo;enlightenment&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;awakening&amp;rdquo; to the true nature of existence, which was later conceptualized as the &amp;ldquo;Four Noble Truths&amp;rdquo;. This day is not and shall not be construed to be a state holiday. [L 1990, c 216, §1] "
