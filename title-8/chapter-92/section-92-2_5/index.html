      <p><strong>ยง92-2.5 Permitted interactions of members</strong>. (a) Two members of a board may discuss between themselves matters relating to official<a></a> board business to enable them to perform their duties faithfully, as long as no commitment to vote is made or sought and the two members do not constitute a quorum of their board.</p>

<p>(b) Two or more members of a board, but less than the number of members which would constitute a quorum for the board, may be assigned to:</p>

<p>(1) Investigate a matter relating to the official business of their board; provided that:</p>

<p>(A) The scope of the investigation and the scope of each member&rsquo;s authority are defined at a meeting of the board;</p>

<p>(B) All resulting findings and recommendations are presented to the board at a meeting of the board; and</p>

<p>&copy; Deliberation and decisionmaking on the matter investigated, if any, occurs only at a duly noticed meeting of the board held subsequent to the meeting at which the findings and recommendations of the investigation were presented to the board; or</p>

<p>(2) Present, discuss, or negotiate any position which the board has adopted at a meeting of the board; provided that the assignment is made and the scope of each member&rsquo;s authority is defined at a meeting of the board prior to the presentation, discussion, or negotiation.</p>

<p>Law Journals and Reviews</p>

<p>Hawai`i&rsquo;s Sunshine Law Compliance Criteria. 26 UH L. Rev. 21.</p>

<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>Even assuming that written memoranda circulated by council members, in which the council members presented proposed actions, included justifications for the proposals, and sought &ldquo;favorable consideration&rdquo; of the proposals constituted a permitted interaction under subsection (a), the memoranda violated the mandate under subsection (b) that no permitted interaction be used to circumvent the spirit or requirements of the sunshine law to make a decision or to deliberate toward a decision upon board business. The &ldquo;express premise&rdquo; of the sunshine law is that opening up the government process to public scrutiny is the only viable and reasonable way to protect the public. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).</p>

<p>Written memoranda circulated by council members, in which the council members presented proposed actions, included justifications for the proposals, and sought &ldquo;favorable consideration&rdquo; of the proposals did not fall within the permitted interaction described in subsection (a) because the memoranda: (1) were distributed among all of the members of the Maui county council rather than among only two members of the board; and (2) sought a commitment to vote by asking for &ldquo;favorable consideration&rdquo; of the proposals contained within them and thus, violated the sunshine law. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).</p>

<p>Although subsection (a) does not expressly preclude city counsel members from engaging in serial one-on-one conversations, when council members engaged in a series of one-on-one conversations relating to a particular item of council business, under ยง92-5(b), the spirit of the open meeting requirement was circumvented and the strong policy of having public bodies deliberate and decide its business in view of the public was thwarted and frustrated. 117 H. 1 (App.), 175 P.3d 111.</p>
