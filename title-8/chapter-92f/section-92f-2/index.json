  "context": "[ยง92F-2] Purposes; rules of construction. In a democracy, the people are vested with the ultimate decision-making power. Government agencies exist to aid the people in the formation and conduct of public policy. Opening up the government processes to public scrutiny and participation is the only viable and reasonable method of protecting the public&amp;rsquo;s interest. Therefore the legislature declares that it is the policy of this State that the formation and conduct of public policy&amp;ndash;the discussions, deliberations, decisions, and action of government agencies&amp;ndash;shall be conducted as openly as possible. The policy of conducting government business as openly as possible must be tempered by a recognition of the right of the people to privacy, as embodied in section 6 and section 7 of article I of the constitution of the state of Hawaii. This chapter shall be applied and construed to promote its underlying purposes and policies, which are to: (1) Promote the public interest in disclosure; (2) Provide for accurate, relevant, timely, and complete government records; (3) Enhance governmental accountability through a general policy of access to government records; (4) Make government accountable to individuals in the collection, use, and dissemination of information relating to them; and (5) Balance the individual privacy interest and the public access interest, allowing access unless it would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
