<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>In a suit deciding whether disclosure of county council executive session minutes was required, circuit court properly found that both chapters 92 and 92F applied; if the meeting met an exception to the open meeting requirements put forth in this chapter 92, such as an exception enumerated in §92-5, the council was not required to disclose the minutes of that meeting to the public; if the meeting did not fall under such an exception, the council was required to disclose the minutes pursuant to §92-9 and this section. 120 H. 34 (App.), 200 P.3d 403.</p>

<p>Where plaintiff&rsquo;s asserted reason for wanting to inspect President Obama&rsquo;s birth records was so that plaintiff could verify whether the President was a natural born citizen and thus eligible to serve as president, and while plaintiff may have had a strong desire to personally verify President Obama&rsquo;s eligibility, such desire did not constitute &ldquo;compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual&rdquo; within the meaning of subsection (b)(3); thus, plaintiff failed to state a claim for relief based on subsection (b)(3). 125 H. 104 (App.), 253 P.3d 665.</p>
