<p>(2) &ldquo;Persons&rdquo; includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, or public or private organizations of any character other than agencies.</p>

<p>(3) &ldquo;Party&rdquo; means each person or agency named or admitted as a party, or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party, in any court or agency proceeding.</p>

<p>(4) &ldquo;Rule&rdquo; means each agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency. The term does not include regulations concerning only the internal management of an agency and not affecting private rights of or procedures available to the public, nor does the term include declaratory rulings issued pursuant to section 91-8, nor intra-agency memoranda.</p>

<p>(5) &ldquo;Contested case&rdquo; means a proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing.</p>

<p>(6) &ldquo;Agency hearing&rdquo; refers only to such hearing held by an agency immediately prior to a judicial review of a contested case as provided in section 91-14. [L 1961, c 103, §1; Supp, §6C-1; <a href="/title-8/chapter-91/section-91-1/">HRS §91-1</a>]</p>

<p>Planning and permitting department&rsquo;s policy of refusing to publicly disclose developer&rsquo;s engineering reports prior to their approval constituted a &ldquo;rule&rdquo;; as this policy was not &ldquo;published or made available for public inspection&rdquo; nor did plaintiff have actual knowledge of the policy prior to its initial request for the reports, department did not comply with this chapter and was proscribed from invoking this policy; thus, department violated this chapter by refusing to publicly disclose any unaccepted engineering reports and written comments, and all of its files, including developer&rsquo;s file, were public records that could be examined upon request. 119 H. 90, 194 P.3d 531.</p>

<p>Where Kauai police department&rsquo;s general order establishing authority and procedures at sobriety checkpoints concerned only the internal management of an agency and did not affect the private rights of or procedures available to the public, the general order was not required to be promulgated pursuant to this chapter. 111 H. 59 (App.), 137 P.3d 373.</p>
