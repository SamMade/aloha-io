In event of a tie for the national popular vote winner, the presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment of the elector slate nominated in association with the presidential slate receiving the largest number of popular votes within that official&amp;rsquo;s own state.

Any member state may withdraw from this agreement, except that a withdrawal occurring six months or less before the end of a President&amp;rsquo;s term shall not become effective until a President or Vice President shall have been qualified to serve the next term. The chief executive of each member state shall promptly notify the chief executive of all other states of when this agreement has been enacted and has taken effect in that official&amp;rsquo;s state, when the state has withdrawn from this agreement, and when this agreement takes effect generally.
