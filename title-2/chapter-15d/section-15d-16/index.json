(a) If a voter&amp;rsquo;s mistake or omission in the completion of a document under this chapter does not prevent determining whether a covered voter is eligible to vote, the mistake or omission shall not invalidate the document. Failure to satisfy a nonsubstantive requirement, such as using paper or envelopes of a specified size or weight, shall not invalidate a document submitted under this chapter. In a write-in ballot authorized by this chapter if the intention of the voter is discernible under this State&amp;rsquo;s uniform definition of what constitutes a vote, an abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be accepted as a valid vote. (b) Notarization is not required for the execution of a document under this chapter. An authentication, other than the declaration on the federal postcard application and federal write-in absentee ballot, shall not be required for execution of a document under this chapter. The declaration and any information in the declaration may be compared with information on file to ascertain the validity of the document. [L 2012, c 226, pt of ยง1] "
