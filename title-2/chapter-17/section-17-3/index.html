The appointee shall be at the time of appointment, and for at least six months immediately prior to the appointment, a member of the political party. The appointee shall, at the time of appointment, be a resident of the same senate district as the prior incumbent. The political party shall submit the list of prospective appointees to the governor within thirty calendar days following the first day of vacancy; and</p>

<p>(2) If the prior incumbent was not a member of any political party, the governor shall, within sixty calendar days following the first day of vacancy, appoint a person who is at the time of appointment a resident of the same senate district as the prior incumbent and who is not, and has not been for at least six months prior to the appointment, a member of any political party.</p>

<p>(b) In the case of a vacancy, the term of which does not end at the next succeeding general election:</p>
