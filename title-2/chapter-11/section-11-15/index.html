<p>(2) Social security number;</p>

<p>(3) Date of birth;</p>

<p>(4) Residence, including mailing address;</p>

<p>(6) That the person is a citizen.</p>

<p>An application to register to vote shall include a space to request a permanent absentee ballot.</p>

<p>(b) The applicant shall swear to the truth of the allegations by self-subscribing affirmation in the affidavit on application for voter registration or other form prescribed by the chief election officer. Unless contested by a qualified voter, the clerk may accept, as prima facie evidence, the allegation of the applicant in information required in the affidavit in subsection (a)(5). In any other case where the clerk shall so desire or believe the same to be expedient, the clerk may demand that the applicant furnish substantiating evidence to the allegations of the applicant&rsquo;s application.</p>

<p>&copy; The applicant shall then affix the applicant&rsquo;s signature to the affidavit.

Affidavits approved by the clerk shall thereupon be numbered appropriately, filed by the clerk, and kept available for election or government purposes in accordance with procedures established by section 11-97.
