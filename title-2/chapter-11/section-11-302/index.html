<p>Case Notes</p>

<p>The definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; was not unconstitutionally vague, where the court agreed with the campaign spending commission that the definition was sufficiently precise without a limiting construction and therefore declined to adopt one. 786 F.3d 1182 (2015).</p>

<p>The definitions of &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; and &ldquo;noncandidate committee&rdquo; were not unconstitutionally vague, where the court adopted the campaign spending commission&rsquo;s proffered construction of the term &ldquo;influence&rdquo; in the definitions to refer only to &ldquo;communications or activities that constitute express advocacy or its functional equivalent&rdquo;. 786 F.3d 1182 (2015).</p>

<p>The &ldquo;noncandidate committee&rdquo; definition and accompanying reporting and disclosure requirements were substantially related to Hawaii&rsquo;s important interests in informing the electorate, preventing corruption or its appearance, and avoiding the circumvention of valid campaign finance laws. Because the burden of complying with the disclosure scheme was modest compared to the significance of the interests being served, the court upheld the noncandidate committee reporting and disclosure requirements, as applied to plaintiff, a for-profit corporation. 786 F.3d 1182 (2015).</p>

<p>It was &ldquo;reasonable and readily apparent&rdquo; that the court narrowly construed relevant Hawaii campaign provisions and interpreted the terms &ldquo;to influence&rdquo; and &ldquo;for the purpose of influencing&rdquo; in the definitions of &ldquo;noncandidate committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; in this section as referring to express advocacy or its functional equivalent; so construed, the meaning of &ldquo;influence&rdquo; was &ldquo;considerably more precise&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ensur[ed] that persons of average intelligence will have reasonable notice of the provisions&rsquo; coverage&rdquo; so as not to offend due process. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p>Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor had standing to challenge the &ldquo;noncandidate committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; definitions in this section, where plaintiff had a good faith basis for believing it should not have to register as a noncandidate committee, giving rise to an actual controversy; if plaintiff ceased registration, but engaged in campaign related activities, it could have subjected itself to possible fines or actions; moreover, a favorable ruling would have allowed plaintiff to cease registration without violating the law. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p>Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor&rsquo;s as-applied challenge to the definition of &ldquo;noncandidate committee&rdquo; in this section failed; plaintiff actively participated in our democracy; it was not unconstitutional to require it to comply with campaign finance laws that are substantially related to important government interests; Hawaii has a substantial interest in imposing noncandidate committee disclosure requirements on an organization&ndash;like plaintiff&ndash;that actively engages in political activity. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p>Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor&rsquo;s as-applied challenge to the disclaimer requirement in ยง11-391(a)(2)(B) and the corresponding definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in this section, which included the &ldquo;electioneering communications&rdquo; definitions in ยง11-341&copy;, rejected; the court concluded that the plaintiff&rsquo;s advertisements fit within the regulatory &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo;&ndash;they were an &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; that was an &ldquo;electioneering communication&rdquo; and was the functional equivalent of express advocacy under ยง11-341&copy;. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p>Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor&rsquo;s challenge to the definition of &ldquo;noncandidate committee&rdquo; in this section failed; the statute was substantially related to important governmental interests as &ldquo;[i]ts coverage vindicates the government&rsquo;s interest in an informed electorate without imposing on nonpolitical organizations unnecessarily&rdquo; and was square with the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United; thus, Hawaii&rsquo;s noncandidate committee requirements did not facially violate the First Amendment. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p>The definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in this section, which was narrowly construed by the court and used the wording &ldquo;advocates or supports the nomination, opposition, or election of the candidate&rdquo;, was not unconstitutionally vague. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p>Cited: 744 F. Supp. 2d 1075 (2010).</p>
