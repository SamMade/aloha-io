The commission may render written advisory opinions upon the request of any candidate, candidate committee, noncandidate committee, or other person or entity subject to this part, as to whether the facts and circumstances of a particular case constitute or will constitute a violation under this part. If no advisory opinion is rendered within ninety days after all information necessary to issue an opinion has been obtained, it shall be deemed that an advisory opinion was rendered and that the facts and circumstances of that particular case do not constitute a violation under this part. The opinion rendered or deemed rendered, until amended or revoked, shall be binding on the commission in any subsequent charges concerning the candidate, any candidate committee or noncandidate committee, or other person or entity subject to this part, who sought the opinion and acted in reliance on it in good faith, unless material facts were omitted or misstated by the requester in the request for an advisory opinion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow the commission to issue rules through an advisory opinion. [L 2010, c 211, pt of ยง2] "
