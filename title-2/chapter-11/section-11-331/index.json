  "context": "D. Reporting and Filing with the Commission Case Notes The &amp;ldquo;noncandidate committee&amp;rdquo; definition and accompanying reporting and disclosure requirements were substantially related to Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s important interests in informing the electorate, preventing corruption or its appearance, and avoiding the circumvention of valid campaign finance laws. Because the burden of complying with the disclosure scheme was modest compared to the significance of the interests being served, the court upheld the noncandidate committee reporting and disclosure requirements, as applied to plaintiff, a for-profit corporation. 786 F.3d 1182 (2015). ยง11-331 Filing of reports, generally. (a) Every report required to be filed by a candidate or candidate committee shall be certified as complete and accurate by the candidate and treasurer. (b) Every report required to be filed by a noncandidate committee shall be certified as complete and accurate by the chairperson and treasurer. &amp;copy; All reports required to be filed under this part shall be filed on the commission&amp;rsquo;s electronic filing system. (d) For purposes of this part, whenever a report is required to be filed with the commission, &amp;ldquo;filed&amp;rdquo; means that a report shall be filed with the commission&amp;rsquo;s electronic filing system by the date and time specified for the filing of the report by: (1) The candidate or candidate committee of a candidate who is seeking election to the: (A) Office of governor; (B) Office of lieutenant governor; &amp;copy; Office of mayor; (D) Office of prosecuting attorney; (E) County council; (F) Senate; (G) House of representatives; or (H) Office of Hawaiian affairs; or (2) A noncandidate committee required to be registered with the commission pursuant to section 11-323.
